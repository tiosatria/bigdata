One evening, she mentioned the overwhelming relief she felt when she asked for a 24-hour extension, only to feel the exact same deadline anxiety and stress the following day as her new deadline approached. </p>\n<p>While I had trouble relating at the time — I was a stickler for deadlines as a student — becoming a freelance writer has made me understand the alternating waves of dread/relief/dread that occurs when you put off a deadline. </p>\n<p>What's interesting about this kind of poor time management cycle is that it's similar to the cycle of debt that occurs when you struggle with money management. In both cases, you're putting off thinking about future demands on your time or money because you're focused on the issues right in front of you. You put off your deadline, or borrow money to pay your rent, forgetting that there's another deadline or bill coming right behind the one you temporarily stalled.</p>\n<p>The good news is that if you're actively tracking your spending and <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-steps-to-successful-budgeting?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sticking to your budget</a>, then you've already mastered time management skills — you just think of them as money management skills. But applying the following budgeting skills to time management will help you feel well-planned and stress free. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/10-time-management-fails-and-how-to-fix-them?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 Time-Management Fails — and How to Fix Them</a>)</p>\n<h2>Pay yourself first</h2>\n<p>We all know that planning to save whatever money is left at the end of the month is a good way to never save anything at all. That's why <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-reasons-you-really-need-to-pay-yourself-first-seriously?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paying yourself first</a> is one of the most important rules of good budgeting. Making sure that your financial plans are funded — before you let today's wants drain your savings — allows you to be a step ahead of future problems.</p>\n<p>If you struggle with time management, you can also get ahead of future problems by paying yourself first. The trick is to take about 15 minutes each morning to review your calendar and make plans before you jump into your work for the day.</p>\n<p>You might feel like you don't have enough time to take 15 minutes each morning for planning. After all, Sheryl in accounting needs that report ASAP and you still haven't prepared for the meeting with the boss. </p>\n<p>But skipping your 15 minutes of planning is like forgoing your savings at the beginning of the month. It leaves you unprepared for things that you could've easily seen coming. Just like a transfer to savings at the beginning of every month means you won't be surprised by an emergency bill (or retirement, for that matter), committing to 15 minutes of planning each morning means you won't be caught blindsided by plans, meetings, deadlines, or other scheduling needs that you might otherwise overlook.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Automate</h2>\n<p>It's a lot easier to save money or pay bills if you don't have to think about it. Setting up an automatic withdrawal from your account every payday means you never have to think about transferring money to your emergency fund or 401(k), and automatic bill pay ensures you never miss a payment. You can simply let the automation do its magic without having to remember a thing. </p>\n<p>Your time management will work better if it's similarly effortless. </p>\n<p>Start by finding any recurring tasks you perform, and set up a way to make them occur automatically. For instance, if you receive a number of emails that require similar responses, creating email templates can help you automate your emails. Instead of crafting a new response each time, you can simply use your templates.</p>\n<p>In addition, automatic reminders via your calendar app can help you to get your recurring tasks done. If you're consistently late turning in your receipts for reimbursement, an automatic reminder can help you remember the due date, give you a nudge a week before to start gathering your receipts, and remind you two days prior to organize your receipts before turning them in.

This is why tracking your spending is such an important part of budgeting. You need to understand where you're being wasteful to know what expenses you can cut.</p>\n<p>Time management requires the same understanding of how you spend. How many of us feel like we're terribly time crunched, only to realize we spend hours on social media. Until you know where you spend your time, you'll struggle to find more time to do the things most important to you.</p>\n<p>Tracking your time can seem overwhelming, but it can help you pinpoint where your days are going. There are several apps that can help you track how and where you spend your time, including Toggl and RescueTime. </p>\n<p>However, keeping an old school time tracker (i.e., on paper) may be even more helpful. As with financial tracking, remembering that you'll have to write down a wasteful decision (whether that's buying something you don't need or watching a YouTube video while you're supposed to be studying) can give you second thoughts about your choice. </p>\n<p>Whether you use technology or paper to track your time, having a snapshot of how you use that time can help you avoid the big time-wasters. Spending hours going down a Twitter rabbit-hole does not help you reach your goals, and tracking helps you realize just how much of a time-suck it is to just \"quickly check\" your feed.

Using the skills you've practiced on your finances can help you feel more in control of your time. And that feeling of control will always feel better than any extension on a deadline.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Couples struggle to get on the same page about their finances because they don't have a shared budget or regular conversations about money. Unfortunately, avoiding the budgeting discussion will do nothing to improve your money stress or your bottom line. It doesn't do much to avert fights about money, either.</p>\n<p>But even if you know all this, your spouse may not be willing to embrace the joys of budgeting. In fact, just bringing up the subject could prompt your partner to leave a person-size hole in the wall as they make a hasty exit.</p>\n<p>Here's how to bring a spouse on board to the necessities of budgeting if they're reluctant to try it. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/4-money-fights-married-couples-have-and-how-to-avoid-them?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4 Money Fights Married Couples Have (And How to Avoid Them)</a>)</p>\n<h2>Start by dreaming big</h2>\n<p>Budgeting is really all about figuring out how you can have the things you want most in life. But most people think of budgeting as deprivation and spreadsheets, which is no one's idea of fun.</p>\n<p>So to get your unwilling spouse on board with budgeting, start by having conversations about what you both want in life. For instance, you might ask your partner what they would do with a million dollars. Not only will this conversation be fun — it's thrilling to think about these kinds of dreams — but it also provides a great jumping off point for starting a budget.</p>\n<p>After your big dreams conversation, you could open a new savings account specifically for the trip to Egypt your spouse has always wanted and start putting aside $5 a week. This shows your spouse that you're taking their dreams seriously, and that a cruise up the Nile is more than just a fun fantasy. Once there's a real trip or other goals that you're working toward, it can be a lot easier to get a reluctant spouse excited about budgeting. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-steps-to-successful-budgeting?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Steps to Successful Budgeting</a>)</p>\n<h2>Work solo on a budget, but ask for input</h2>\n<p>In every marriage, there are tasks that one spouse takes over because the other spouse isn't interested in handling it. Maybe she handles all the lawn care while he does the grocery shopping and cooking. So there's nothing wrong with creating a budget by yourself if your spouse has made it clear that they're not interested.</p>\n<p>However, even if your partner says they want nothing to do with budgeting, it's still very important to make them part of the process. Put together your monthly spending plan solo, but ask your partner for their opinion after you're done. Not only will this show them that you care about their input, but they may also have a different viewpoint of various spending categories. For instance, if your partner handles the cooking, they may recognize when you have over- or under-budgeted for grocery shopping. </p>\n<p>In addition, you can potentially ask your spouse if there are any places to trim the fat that you hadn't thought of. If you've already started setting aside money for a big dream you share, this will make this request even more motivating, since your spouse will recognize that you're trying to reach that dream faster. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/11-budgeting-skills-everyone-should-master?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11 Budgeting Skills Everyone Should Master</a>)</p>\n<h2>Let your budget work its magic</h2>\n<p>While budgeting is much easier if everyone is on board, you can still improve your bottom line and reduce your stress while working by yourself. Even if dreaming big and asking for input don't motivate your partner, seeing a budget actually work can make a big difference. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>For instance, let's say you and your spouse find yourselves stressed and scrambling every six months when it comes time to pay for car insurance. Since you've started implementing your budget, you've decided to put aside $75 per month toward that bill. When it comes due, instead of feeling overwhelmed and panicked like you normally do, the amount of money you need is already set aside and ready. </p>\n<p>Simply sharing this win with your spouse could do a lot to bring them around to the benefits of budgeting. This is especially true if you used to have arguments or stressful scenes every time this bill came due.</p>\n<h2>Celebrate the wins together</h2>\n<p>Pointing out the ways that things are improving is a great method for encouraging your spouse to take ownership of your budget. For instance, if you spend less on dining out because you're making more of an effort to cook at home, you could ask for their input on how to celebrate. You might say: </p>\n<p><em>\"Check out how much we saved this month by cooking at home! I'd like to put most of it toward our credit card debt, but let's think about how we can enjoy some of this saved money. What do you think we should spend it on?\"</em></p>\n<p>Sharing the benefits of your budget with your spouse, even if they haven't done the same budgeting work that you've put in, can help make it clear that your budget is a joint endeavor.</p>\n<h2>From reluctance to excitement</h2>\n<p>The majority of budgeting fears stem from a sense that it will be both boring and limiting. Bringing your spouse on board means showing them that budgeting offers both fun and freedom. Consistently focusing on big goals, doing the budgeting work yourself while always asking for input, letting the budget do its job, and sharing the wins can all help your foot-dragging spouse to embrace the budget. </p>\n<p>In time, your spouse may even say those three little words everyone wants to hear from their sweetheart: \"You were right.\"</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

One of the examples Thaler and Sunstein include in their book is the cafeteria that nudged diners into healthy eating habits by placing fruits and other healthy snacks at eye level, while putting chips and ice cream in harder-to-reach spots. No one was prevented from seeking out their favorite junk food, but the set up of the offerings encouraged diners to choose apple slices instead.</p>\n<p>A similar successful nudge was the introduction of automatic 401(k) enrollment. When employees had to opt-in to their 401(k) program, participation was abysmal, since signing up for a retirement account is the kind of important-but-not-urgent task that many people procrastinate on. By making enrollment automatic, employees could productively ignore their 401(k), rather than ignore it at their peril. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/401k-or-ira-you-need-both?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">401(k) or IRA? You Need Both</a>)</p>\n<p>But even though nudges have proven successful in several arenas, they're not perfect. In fact, nudges don't always work and can sometimes even backfire. Here's why nudges aren't always the best way to go about changing your habits.</p>\n<h2>Strong preferences</h2>\n<p>I'm an avid reader and a big supporter of public libraries. I'm at the library as often as twice a week. Despite this, I carry an average overdue fine balance of close to $10 at any one time, and I once wracked up an impressive $75 fine on a stack of books that remained in my library bag for weeks.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I've tried various nudges to improve my on-time return rate. I've left books on the table by the door, set a Google calendar reminder, written my due dates on my paper calendar, left books in my car, and I've even placed \"return library books\" on my work to-do list. Not a single one of these nudges has worked.</p>\n<p>What's going on here is that my preexisting preferences are far stronger than my nudges to return the books. I prefer to leave the house with just enough time to get where I'm going without an extra stop at the library and I prefer to keep working throughout the day without an interruption to return books. Those preferences will guide me no matter how insistent my nudge is, because a nudge does not take away my choices. </p>\n<p>Strong preferences can also help to explain the phenomenon of non-compliant patients. No matter what nudges the medical profession has attempted to implement to improve patient compliance, many patients have such a strong preexisting preference to maintain their old eating and exercise habits that they'll simply ignore their doctor's recommendations. Even when it comes to taking medication, the preference to not take it is greater than even some financial nudges that pay patients to comply.</p>\n<p>Though nudges can help to improve habits, they will not overcome strong preferences. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-use-financial-anchors-to-make-better-money-decisions?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Use Financial Anchors to Make Better Money Decisions</a>)</p>\n<h2>Incomplete nudges</h2>\n<p>Sometimes nudges work, but only a little bit. That's because a nudge is encouraging a specific small behavior, when the overall outcome that you're trying to achieve is complex. </p>\n<p>For instance, a grocery store <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/why-nudging-your-customers-can-backfire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased its produce sales by 9 percent</a> after installing green arrows pointing toward the produce section with a sign that said, \"Follow the green arrow for your health.\" While it's certainly beneficial for shoppers to buy more produce, that's not the end of the beneficial habit. How many of those grocery shoppers let their purchased produce rot in their refrigerators? Particularly if their preexisting preference is for junk food?</p>\n<p>Similarly, the cafeteria nudge that gets diners to choose apples instead of chips at lunchtime may be an incomplete nudge if the diner simply chooses unhealthy snacks for the rest of the day. The nudge within the cafeteria's confines may have worked, but it was incomplete in terms of helping to change the diner's overall eating habits.</p>\n<h2>Reactive behavior</h2>\n<p>The basis of the theory of nudging is that people aren't making the best decisions for themselves. This may be because people are distracted, overwhelmed, or suffering from <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-mental-biases-that-are-keeping-you-poor?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cognitive biases</a>. But if you're aware that someone is nudging you, it can be easy to feel as though the nudger doesn't think much of your intelligence.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>When that happens, the fact that you're being nudged can cause you to choose another option out of stubbornness. Parents of small children are certainly familiar with this. If I give my son the choice of jeans or khakis, in an attempt to nudge him to choose long pants on a chilly day, he might refuse both and insist on wearing shorts just because I tried to influence his decision.</p>\n<p>This refusal to comply with a nudge may explain what happened after New York City required restaurants to list the calorie content of all menu items. Instead of nudging consumers to choose lower-calorie items, this change prompted average <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/04/the-limits-of-nudges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">restaurant-goers to buy slightly more calories</a>. The nudge did not have its desired effect, in part because some diners probably felt resentful about the attempt to change their choices. This may have prompted them to either disregard the calorie counts, or gleefully indulge in the highest-calorie item they could find.</p>\n<h2>Over-saturation</h2>\n<p>I have an alarm that goes off every day at 7:30 a.m. to remind me to take my medication. My FitBit buzzes at 10 minutes to the hour if I haven't taken at least 250 steps that hour. My phone informs me at 9 p.m. every night that it's time for me to start getting ready for bed.</p>\n<p>I ignore every single one of these nudges more often than I heed them.</p>\n<p>Not only have I gotten used to these alarms, buzzers, and bells going off throughout my day, making them very easy to ignore, but I also know that there will be no immediate consequences if I don't take my medication, continue sitting for hours at a time, or stay up too late. </p>\n<p>These nudges were more effective when I first set them — although my strong preexisting preferences made it difficult to comply even then. But now that my day is over-saturated in nudges that I've learned to ignore, the reminders are nothing more than momentary annoyances that I quickly turn off.</p>\n<p>With the onslaught of nudges from our smartphones, wearable devices, and home assistants, all of these reminders can become nothing more than background noise. </p>\n<h2>Nudges are the start, not the end</h2>\n<p>Nudge theory has done a great deal to change the landscape of modern decision-making. But while nudges can help to steer decisions, they're still only gentle suggestions. </p>\n<p>Even if you set up your environment to encourage better choices, you need to remember that habit-change requires commitment, not just nudges.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Whenever my mother found a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's in my grandmother's ice box, Grandma's excuse was always the same, \"Oh, the little bit I have won't hurt me!\"</p>\n<p>The thing about Grandma's excuse (that often made the vein in my mother's forehead start to pulse) was that she would have been right about one hot fudge sundae. A single decision to disregard her doctor's orders would not have made a difference in her health. The problem is that small decisions have a way of compounding, and my grandmother made her health issues worse one ice cream cone at a time.</p>\n<p>The buildup of small decisions can be costly, whether you're trying to improve your health or your finances. Here's how small decisions can create big problems.</p>\n<h2>The tyranny of small decisions</h2>\n<p>In a 1966 essay titled <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6435.1966.tb02491.x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Tyranny of Small Decisions</a>, economist Alfred Kahn describes how a well-meaning individual making a series of small decisions can end up with an unintended and unwanted large decision. </p>\n<p>Kahn used the example of the Ithaca railroad to explain how small decisions can have devastating consequences. Rail was the only consistent mode of travel in and out of Ithaca, New York, as it could operate in any weather. But cars, buses, and planes offered faster and more convenient service in good weather. Travelers in and out of Ithaca consistently made the small, individual decision to take the most convenient service when the weather was fine. Because of these small decisions, the rail service was eventually discontinued because there were not enough travelers to cover the costs — which effectively made Ithaca unreachable in bad weather.</p>\n<p>Every traveler who made the small decision to take a bus or plane did not intend for the rail service to dry up, but the cumulative effect of those small decisions created an enormous, negative and unintended consequence. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-guilty-pleasures-that-are-killing-your-budget?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 Guilty Pleasures That Are Killing Your Budget</a>)</p>\n<h2>The latte factor</h2>\n<p>Though it has become something of a cliche, the latte factor is a common example of how the tyranny of small decisions can impact your budget. Popularized by financial expert and author David Bach, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/learning-how-to-become-a-money-master-from-author-david-bach?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the latte factor</a> describes how making regular small purchases, such as a daily $4 latte, can add up to a big payout that you don't intend to make. Make an unnecessary $4 purchase every day, and you spend over $1,400 per year.</p>\n<p>This is what's so insidious about the tyranny of small decisions. Anyone who spends $1,400 on a single large purchase would at least have something of worth to show for the hole in their budget. But spending money a little at a time on small indulgences means you can't even point to where your money has gone. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/heres-how-rich-youd-be-if-you-stopped-drinking-expensive-coffee?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here's How Rich You'd Be if You Stopped Drinking Expensive Coffee</a>)</p>\n<h2>Easy payments and small decisions</h2>\n<p>Another important factor in how the tyranny of small decisions can destroy a budget is the fact that we now live in a largely cashless society. When you're making small purchase decisions using cash, the amount of money you have in your wallet is a natural reminder of how much you have spent.</p>\n<p>However, it can be very easy to lose track of how much you've spent when you're using plastic to pay for everything. Each individual spending decision you make is a little thing that won't hurt your finances. But in aggregate, the decisions add up to a total dollar amount that you didn't intend to spend.</p>\n<h2>Aligning your choices with your values</h2>\n<p>Travelers to Ithaca didn't realize that prioritizing convenience on any one trip would mean the end of the rail travel they valued. Similarly, someone who isn't paying close attention to how much they're spending won't realize that their choices are adding up to something they do not want.</p>\n<p>To combat this, it's important to align your choices with your values as often as you can. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>For instance, let's say one of your values is to support local businesses. Any single trip you take to the big box store or any single item you order from Amazon will not affect the local businesses. However, if you find yourself stopping at Wal-Mart or ordering online all the time, then you're prioritizing convenience over supporting local businesses.</p>\n<p>There's nothing wrong with valuing convenience, but you need to remember that you probably can't have both convenience and a thriving local business district at the same time. So you'll need to make sure you make choices that show your support for local business at least some of the time. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/4-ways-your-money-can-support-your-values?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4 Ways Your Money Can Support Your Values</a>)</p>\n<h2>Forced value alignment</h2>\n<p>Of course, it's difficult to align all your small choices with your values because each small decision feels like it's consequence-free. With no looming negative consequence on the horizon, it can feel a little ridiculous to ask yourself if buying this particular cup of coffee and a muffin will help you reach your overall financial goals. One good way to enforce value alignment is to take away your ability to make these small choices. </p>\n<p>For instance, the standard advice about carrying cash instead of credit cards is part of the personal finance greatest hits list for a reason. When you use cash, you're forced to consider your values when making small decisions, since the resource dwindles before your eyes.</p>\n<p>This kind of forced alignment can help defeat the tyranny of any number of small decisions. Here are a few examples: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consumers who wish to support small local businesses could enforce that value alignment by signing up for social media updates to make sure those businesses stay on their radar. <br>\n     </li>\n<li>Travelers who value an underused service could commit to taking that service rather than focusing solely on convenience. <br>\n     </li>\n<li>Folks who would like to eat healthier or lose weight could make sure the tub of butter pecan ice cream never makes it to their kitchen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Don't let small decisions pile up</h2>\n<p>It may be true that the little choices you make won't hurt you, but it can be easy to lose track of how small choices add up quickly. Rather than making each small decision out of context, take the time to figure out what you value and how your small choices will fit into those values.

Each night, I drew and colored in each piece corresponding to all of the cleaning tasks I'd taken care of that day. After coloring in my board every night for five weeks, I was absolutely certain that this time I would finally achieve my goal of having an effortlessly and continuously clean house.</p>\n<p>I was doing everything right according to habit research. I'd created a game to give myself extrinsic motivation until the new habit took over. Repeating that habit every night for weeks meant I was well on my way to my goal.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I'm currently sitting in a house that's a mess, and I haven't updated my board since March.</p>\n<p>It turns out that reaching a goal can be incredibly difficult even if you set yourself up for success by creating a new habit. That's because of something called \"habit boredom,\" which is the weakening of your positive emotional response to an action once it becomes habitual.</p>\n<p>Here's what you need to know about how habit boredom can create setbacks with your goals, just when you think you're finally on your way to reaching them.</p>\n<h2>Understanding habit boredom</h2>\n<p>Establishing good habits has long been touted as a way to reach your goals. After all, researchers have found that about <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/08/140808111931.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40 percent of your daily activities</a> are performed habitually. Creating beneficial habits — like putting things away, making a bag lunch to take to work each day, and drinking a glass of water before each meal — can ensure that your actions are working toward your goals of a cleaner house, better finances, and improved health.</p>\n<p>The problem is that intentionally creating a new and beneficial habit means you have an emotional response to it. For instance, you may feel proud of yourself when you begin your habit of packing a lunch each day. Look at you, starting a new money-saving habit! You can puff out your chest with pride as you calculate how much you're saving with each homemade sandwich.</p>\n<p>But that emotional response is not going to be quite as strong on day 17. That's because the process of creating a habit also numbs your emotional response to that habit. In other words, as the habit takes over, you're more likely to feel bored by it, since it's no longer novel.</p>\n<p>By that point, throwing together some turkey and cheese on wheat is no longer something to be proud of — it's just Tuesday. And when your coworkers ask if you want to check out the new taco truck, the fact that you no longer have a strong emotional connection to your lunch-making habit means it'll be easy to let your poor sandwich get soggy in the refrigerator while you enjoy some tacos.</p>\n<h2>Combatting habit boredom</h2>\n<p>Part of the problem with habit boredom is the fact that you may not realize that's why you're abandoning your newly-formed habit. It may seem rational to just skip your new routine one time because you're tired, hungry, busy, or otherwise unable to let the habitual action take over.</p>\n<p>However, habit boredom means you're resistant to making your usual brown bag lunch the next day, too. And the one after that.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of ways to keep habit boredom from wrecking all your progress, however.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Fall in love with the boredom</h3>\n<p>Habit and productivity expert James Clear writes in his book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/30ncGFM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> that truly elite goal-setters find a way to enjoy the boredom of their habits. If the only path to become an Olympic athlete is to spend each day doing boring, repetitive athletic exercises, then those individuals who are capable of finding ways to enjoy the boredom have a leg up over those who feel like doing yet another set is about as interesting as watching paint dry.</p>\n<p>So how do you go about falling in love with boredom?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pair your boring habit with something novel.</strong> Adding a fun motivator to your new habit can help you keep going with a habit that has lost its sheen. For instance, if you're trying to keep your brown bag lunch habit going, you could use fun and colorful food storage, start cutting your sandwiches into shapes, or even experiment with recipes and snacks you've always wanted to try.<br>\n     </li>\n<li><strong>Partner with a friend. </strong>You probably already know that exercise is more fun with a buddy. So is any other boring, repetitive habit. If you're trying to establish a money-saving habit, partner up with a friend who is also trying to start a new habit. Holding each other accountable can help you both stay on track when habit boredom strikes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Embrace the process orientation</h3>\n<p>We generally establish new habits because we have a goal in mind. The problem is that habit boredom can make us feel like we've failed if the boredom strikes before we've reached the goal.</p>\n<p>When you're focused solely on a goal, whether that goal is a cleaner house, better finances, or improved health, you often focus on the question, \"Can I do this?\" rather than \"How do I do this?\" The first question assumes that failure is an option. The second assumes that you will succeed and prompts you to figure out your process for doing so.</p>\n<p>That's why the process orientation, which focuses on how to do something, is more likely to lead to success. The guiding principle of process orientation is the mantra \"there are no failures, only ineffective solutions.\"</p>\n<p>If your habit boredom leads you to abandoning your new habit, there's no need to feel like you're never going to reach your goal. You just need to tweak your solution to see if it'll better help you reach it. When you're open to asking yourself why something didn't work, you're more likely to find a solution that will work rather than simply abandon the habit and goal altogether.

Here's Why.</a>)</p>\n<h2>The double-edged sword of habits</h2>\n<p>Becoming a creature of habit can do a great deal to help you reach your goals if you're intentional about your habits. But human beings are not machines that can be programmed and left to run.</p>\n<p>We need to consistently tweak our habits, indulge our need for motivation and novelty, and recognize that reaching our goals is a process that may require a number of fits and starts.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for me, that means not even a beautifully rendered bullet journal Tetris board is sure to overcome the problem of habit boredom.

The 2017 Annual American Time Use Survey from the U.S. Department of Labor revealed that people with full-time jobs spend more than <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/american-time-use/activity-by-emp.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two hours a day on chores</a> including cleaning, cooking, and shopping.</p>\n<p>The gig economy claims to rescue us from this time crunch with a host of apps that relieve us of the need to shop, do laundry, care for pets, or cook. But do they really save you enough time to be worth the money? Let's look at some of the chores and errands we all have, and the apps that claim to save us time by taking over those tasks.</p>\n<h2>1. Grocery shopping</h2>\n<p>Most people shop for food once or twice a week, spending an <a href=\"http://www.timeuseinstitute.org/Grocery16paper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">average of 43 minutes</a> in the store each trip, plus travel time. This means having a gig worker shop for you could save you two hours each week — more if you live far from a store, your store tends to be very crowded, or you shop more than twice a week.</p>\n<p>While grocery delivery from just one store or warehouse, in the form of Peapod, Safeway.com, or Amazon Fresh, has been around for awhile, the appeal of getting your groceries through a gig app is that you get to choose what store the items come from, and deliveries can often be scheduled in as little as an hour. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-having-your-groceries-delivered-can-save-you-money?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 Ways Having Your Groceries Delivered Can Save You Money</a>)</p>\n<h3>The cost</h3>\n<p>Instacart, Postmates, and Shipt (owned by Target) all charge a per-delivery, annual, or monthly fee for groceries delivered by gig workers driving their own cars.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For Instacart, it's $3.99 to $7.99 per order, or $99 a year.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Postmates charges $9.99 a month or $95.88 a year, or a variable per-delivery fee of up to $20 per order.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Shipt, which delivers in 257 cities, charges $14 a month or $99 a year. If you choose to tip the delivery person, include that in your cost as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also keep in mind that the per-item prices you're paying through these services might be more than the prices at the store. Instacart acknowledges markups on its site. For instance, for my main store, Safeway, it says \"Item prices are higher than in-store prices in your area.\" Shipt comes out and <a href=\"https://help.shipt.com/pricing/how-are-your-prices-determined\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tells its users</a> that it's marking up groceries from \"select retailers\" as a form of service fee.</p>\n<h3>Cost per hour saved</h3>\n<p>Of course, you'll still spend some time selecting groceries on these apps and placing your order, but you'll save the time you would have spent driving to the store, parking, walking through the aisles and (worst of all) waiting in line. If you pay $150 a year in fees for one of these services to save two hours per week, that's a cost of only about $1.50 per hour saved. If you only would have spent an extra hour each week shopping, you'd be paying about $3 per hour saved.</p>\n<h3>Is it worth it?</h3>\n<p>If you make more than $20 an hour, it's probably a good deal to use a gig shopping app, especially if you don't own a car or work hours that make it difficult to get to the store outside of busy hours.</p>\n<h2>2. Dog walking</h2>\n<p>Walking the dog can be fun and good exercise, but if you have a long commute to work, getting the dog out midday can be impossible. Or maybe you're just too busy to give the dog as much exercise as he or she needs.</p>\n<h3>The cost</h3>\n<p>Wag! and Rover can send a gig worker to your door on demand or on a schedule to take out the pooch, at a cost of about $20 to $30 per 20- to 30-minute walk.</p>\n<h3>Cost per hour saved</h3>\n<p>If you're only saving the time it takes to walk the dog, you're spending about $1 per minute, or $60 an hour, which makes this service a pricey way to save time. However, more people probably use these services for workday walks. If you work 30 minutes from home, that $30 fee could be saving you 90 minutes, when you consider the walk and the round-trip travel.</p>\n<h3>Is it worth it?</h3>\n<p>If you're home, probably not. No matter how busy you are, it will likely do you good and might even make you more productive to get out for a walk with your pet. But if you're at work, it may be a good deal. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-make-400-a-week-as-a-pet-sitter?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Make $400+ a Week as a Pet Sitter</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Food delivery</h2>\n<p>Of all purported time-saving gig apps, food delivery apps such as Uber Eats, Caviar, and Postmates (for takeout, not groceries) make it hardest to pin down the benefits. Before these apps, you could already pick up the phone and order takeout, or hop in the car and hit the McDonald's drive thru.</p>\n<p>So what do the gig apps add to the bargain? Each has its specialty. Caviar focuses on restaurants that didn't previously offer delivery, so you're probably saving driving time, parking, and waiting in line to pick up an order from a busy spot. If you're comparing ordering through one of these services to driving to the restaurant and having a sit-down meal, it might save hours, but for those who enjoy the restaurant ambience, that might not be a win.</p>\n<p>The least time one of these apps can save you is the time of placing an order by phone, which by my count saves only about three minutes — but since ordering on the phone is annoying, those might be the best three minutes you ever saved.</p>\n<h3>The cost</h3>\n<p>Uber Eats charges fees of $2 to $8, depending on the distance of the customer to the restaurant, plus surge pricing if applicable. Caviar charges a variable delivery fee plus an 18 percent service fee. Postmates' $9.99 a month or $95.88 annual membership covers food delivery as well as groceries; non-members pay delivery fees of $3.99 to $9.99 per order or more during surge periods. </p>\n<h3>Cost per hour saved</h3>\n<p>Let's assume that the true time saved by ordering food through a gig app is 30 minutes, the time you'd take to place a phone order for takeout and drive to pick it up. If you order once a week through a Postmates annual membership, and tip $5 on each delivery, the service is costing you $7 per half hour saved, or $14 per hour.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Is it worth it?</h3>\n<p>If you order food often from restaurants that don't offer delivery, yes. For those bored with their regular delivery spots, these apps can really spice things up. But if you prefer to cook at home, eat at the restaurant, or have regular favorites who deliver, these apps may not be worth trying for you.</p>\n<h2>4. Doctor visits</h2>\n<p>It might be a shock to learn that some doctors are embracing the <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/what-pays-more-online-surveys-or-the-gig-economy?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gig economy</a>. But a host of startups are making it possible for doctors to make house calls or practice telemedicine in their spare time, or as their main practice.</p>\n<p>If you're having a heart attack or just lost an appendage, clearly convenience isn't going to be the deciding factor and you'll need to head straight to an emergency room, preferably in an ambulance. However, if you have a urinary tract infection, a rash, you need an order for a strep test, have a suspected case of the flu, or just need a prescription refill, a doctor's office, urgent care, or emergency room visit can eat up hours of your life. In some practices I've used, just calling to make an appointment can take 15 minutes or more waiting on hold.</p>\n<p>Then there's getting to the doctor's office and sitting in the waiting room — average wait times range from <a href=\"https://www.vitals.com/about/wait-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15 to 27 minutes</a>, depending on the city and type of doctor.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the app Doctor on Demand can put you on a 15-minute call with a freelance doctor within five minutes. Then there are apps that allow you to schedule a house call with freelance doctors, such as Heal. For simple complaints, the potential time savings ranges from one hour on an easy doctor visit to five or more hours for one of those nightmare ER waits.</p>\n<h3>The cost</h3>\n<p>Doctor on Demand charges <a href=\"https://doctorondemand.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200847977-How-much-does-your-service-cost-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$75 for a 15-minute consultation</a>, and they work with a number of employers and insurance companies. Heal charges a $149 flat fee, and also accepts a number of insurance plans.</p>\n<h3>Cost per hour saved</h3>\n<p>For an office visit, assuming you pay the app out of pocket, and your insurance copay for your regular doctor would have been $20, it may cost $55 to $79 to save one hour. If you can use one of these services to avoid an ER visit, the cost might be about the same, and you could save <em>at least</em> two hours.</p>\n<h3>Is it worth it?</h3>\n<p>If you can use one of these services to avoid an emergency room visit for a non-emergency, it could be <em>very</em> worthwhile.</p>\n<p>For office visits, if one of these programs is covered by your insurance, it seems like a worthwhile thing to try. If you have to pay out of pocket, the time-saving would be worthwhile for high earners or those with very busy doctors offices.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

We didn't have it listed for sale. The condo was in great condition, the rent we charged covered expenses, and it was in a very nice area that consistently attracted stable tenants. My husband and I took about five minutes to confer before deciding to accept the offer.</p>\n<p>The offer was cash. We estimated it was about $10,000 less than we <em>might </em>have made through a traditional sale. After accounting for realtor commissions, taxes, and the time required to sell our condo; we felt the convenience of an as-is cash sale was worth it. The closing took less than two weeks. By the end of August, we had an extra $35,000 in the bank.</p>\n<p>Selling your house for cash can be a dream come true. In these cases, investors are looking for a quick transaction. They aren't generally concerned with repairs. Real estate agents are not involved, so the cost of a broker's commission is waived. In my case, the inspection walkthrough was merely a formality. The as-is cash closing was also a piece of cake.

They already owned other rental units in the building, so we were able to verify their legitimacy quickly. However, all that glitters is not gold. This industry is rife with scammers looking to swindle you, and you should be careful working with people who advertise a service to buy houses for cash on traditional media sources, online, or even street corners (we've all seen the signs nailed to light posts).</p>\n<p>If you're considering selling your house for cash to an investor, make sure you do your homework, and back away if you detect any of the following red flags.</p>\n<h2>It's a foreign investor</h2>\n<p>People who contact you from foreign countries offering to buy your house sight unseen should set off alarm bells. In some cases, scammers submit legal-looking documents or send you to websites that look professional. They might say they're moving to another country for work. However, these people are either never available to speak in person or don't have a local representative to work with directly. In some cases, the scam artists will send a foreign check with a mistaken overpayment. They ask unsuspecting homeowners to refund the overpayment only to find that the check doesn't clear. This will leave the homeowner on the hook for whatever monies were transferred out.</p>\n<p>Be wary of dealing with buyers in foreign countries who aren't readily available by phone or video conference. And never take any action with funds deposited until you've waited the requisite time for a check to clear.

However, once a deal is reached, someone should want to inspect the property in person. If you're dealing with a potential investor who only wants to communicate via email, you might be dealing with a scammer. Legitimate buyers have no problem showing up and walking through a property they intend to purchase.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>The investor doesn't negotiate</h2>\n<p>As-is cash home buyers are in this market to find deals. They aren't interested in paying the market rate for any property. The investors will negotiate the price down to account for any repairs needed so they can sell the home again for a profit. Homeowners willing to sell to an as-is cash buyer must be willing to accept a significant reduction in their asking price.</p>\n<p>If you're communicating with a potential buyer who requires no repairs and is willing to pay top dollar for your home, run. Anyone offering full price for a house without requiring any work on your end is likely trying to rip you off. </p>\n<h2>How to avoid a scam</h2>\n<p>There are plenty of legitimate investors or buyers who are willing to pay cash for your home as-is. This type of transaction works well for those who don't have the money to make repairs or renovations needed. You may also like the idea of a fast, hassle-free closing. Maybe you've become an accidental landlord after relocating, or you've inherited a house from a family member and you want out of the arrangement.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of good reasons to approach a quick-buy investor, and homeowners can still make smart choices in pursuing this type of transaction. Here's how to do it right.</p>\n<h3>Google the investor</h3>\n<p>Always do a Google search and look for independent reviews online. Angry people who are swindled out of money tend to leave a trail in cyberspace. Start with a quick search on the company's or investor's name. You should also check to see if they're members of the Better Business Bureau, or if there are any complaints with the State Attorney's office.</p>\n<h3>Hire a lawyer</h3>\n<p>While not required, hiring an attorney can help ensure that the process is followed correctly and legally. Legitimate investors will welcome this process.</p>\n<h3>Check references</h3>\n<p>Follow up with their references. Legitimate investors will have worked with other homeowners who can share their experience — good or bad.</p>\n<h3>Pay attention to how they present themselves</h3>\n<p>Keep an eye on their professionalism. If their correspondence is laden with typos, or their forms of advertising are sketchy (illegal posters nailed to light posts, for example), you should avoid them. If an investor doesn't present professionally and you want to sell your home for as-is for cash, find someone who does.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Since we can't frequent our favorite coffee shops and restaurants, we should at least be able to prepare healthy and delicious meals at home.</p>\n<p>And taking that a step further, you should also make sure you have a wide variety of kitchen tools and gadgets to help you master the art of meal preparation. Even if you have all the basic kitchen staples that allow you to cook regular meals, you might be used to the convenience of your office's espresso machine, or the fresh pressed juice that the cafÃ© down the street makes with zero pulp. These are things you can replicate at home with the right kitchen tools — all without breaking the bank.

Financial infidelity is when one partner makes significant money decisions without consulting the other. If one spouse has taken out a secret credit card, opened up a secret bank account, hides purchases or statements, or if cash goes missing, then these are all red flags.</p>\n<p>This is bigger than a mere budgeting issue. There's a breach of trust and communication in your marriage, and it's wise to seek out the help of a marriage counselor to get to the root of the problem, and remedy the issue.

Perhaps one spouse is too uptight about the budget or goes off the handle for overspending or debt. Maybe one spouse feels too restricted and spends freely because they feel they have the right to do so.</p>\n<p>Again, this is more than just a budget issue. There are internal struggles that both you and your spouse need to identify in yourselves and in each other. Perhaps one partner is constantly nagging about the budget because they grew up in poverty and debt. Maybe one partner spends recklessly because they don't feel valued or appreciated. A marriage counselor can help you both look past the money issues to see if there are deeper problems at hand. And once the trigger is discovered, it's easier to resolve the behaviors attached.

If one spouse is fighting an addiction that impacts the finances, then it's best to come to an agreement on how to protect your shared money. This might mean that the spouse battling addiction is taken off all financial accounts until they have sought out treatment and therapy.</p>\n<p>Not only does the partner with the addiction need to seek out individual therapy, but a few sessions with a marital counselor can help mend broken communication and hurt feelings that resulted from the addiction. With the help of a marriage counselor, you can determine how to help your spouse on their journey to recovery.</p>\n<h2>There is a possibility of financial abuse</h2>\n<p>Does your spouse have full control of the finances and won't let you have access to bank accounts or credit cards? Do you have to ask for an allowance or get permission to get a job in order to pay for your basic needs? There could be an issue with financial abuse, and if your spouse is willing to see a counselor, then let that be your first step. Perhaps your spouse is not fully aware that they are committing financial abuse, or that as a married couple, you have rights to all shared income.</p>\n<p>Financial abuse is a serious issue, and it's considered a form of domestic abuse. You can contact the <a href=\"https://nnedv.org/content/about-financial-abuse/\" target=\"_blank\">National Network to End Domestic Violence</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/\" target=\"_blank\">National Domestic Abuse Hotline</a> if you feel you are a victim of financial abuse. These sites also list additional forms of financial abuse to watch out for, as well as several resources for anyone who feels stuck in a marriage like this.

The latter of which will cost you a lot of unnecessary money, stress, and frustration. Use best practices, however — as offered by real estate experts below — and you'll walk away a winner with a smile on your face and cash still in your bank account.</p>\n<h2>1. Research agents before choosing one</h2>\n<p>Selecting the right real estate agent can make all the difference when it comes to finding your dream home and negotiating the best price. Carlos Miramontez, vice president of mortgage lending at a California credit union, offers a few pointers on narrowing down the agent pool.</p>\n<p>\"Doing your research upfront can help you make a wise decision and choose a well-qualified real estate agent who's right for your needs,\" he writes on the company blog. \"Remember that you're creating a business relationship. It's important that you work well together, as it could be several months before the entire buying or selling process is complete. Enjoy a cup a coffee with a few agents before you make the decision on which partner is right for you.\"</p>\n<p>There also are specific questions you should be asking your agent, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How often will you send me listings?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Will you show me homes when I'm available (e.g., after work or on the weekends)?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>How long have you worked in real estate?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>What type of property do you specialize in (e.g., condos, single-family, or town homes)?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Have you worked with other clients in my desired area and price range?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Search social media for local real estate groups</h2>\n<p>Social media is a great resource for connecting with real estate agents in an unfamiliar area, says Brady Hanna, president of Mill Creek Home Buyers in Kansas City, who has been buying, renting, and flipping houses for over a decade.</p>\n<p>\"Search on Facebook for real estate groups in your local area,\" he says. \"You will be surprised to find that there will probably be 10 or more. Join all of them, including investor and wholesaler groups. Then post across all of these groups that you are looking to buy a house in ABC area, what your criteria is, and if they have any off-market properties to send your way, and include your email address. You would be amazed at how many people will send you off-market properties using this technique. I have bought six properties in the last few months just from local Facebook groups.\" (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-things-your-real-estate-agent-wishes-you-knew?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Things Your Real Estate Agent Wishes You Knew</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Add a personal touch when there are multiple offers</h2>\n<p>How do you stand out in a pool of potential buyers? Send a personal note to the seller with a creative story about yourself, why you're the best buyer for the house, and your plan to make it a home.</p>\n<p>\"If you talk about your family in the letter, you will pull at the heartstrings of the seller and have a much better chance of being selected if you have a similar offer than another buyer,\" Hanna says. \"I have experienced this personally when selling houses and every time I picked the buyer that wrote the personal note when I had multiple similar offers.\"(See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/4-times-a-handwritten-letter-can-save-you-big-bucks?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4 Times a Handwritten Letter Can Save You Big Bucks</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Don't automatically settle on city living</h2>\n<p>Life in the city is attractive and convenient for a lot of people, especially if you're the type that likes to have necessities within walking distance. But even though life's essentials are easily accessible, the financial picture over time may rob you of a certain quality of life.</p>\n<p>\"Be sure to check out properties in the 'burbs and take the cost and time of your commute into consideration,\" suggests Shane Lee, data analyst for RealtyHop. \"While the city life is always amazing, you might find a way better deal in the burbs. You can even find a fixer upper and make it your dream house with the money you save on the purchase.\"</p>\n<h2>5. Run through all costs before starting the home-buying process</h2>\n<p>Most first-time home-buyers concentrate on the down payment — the largest of all the out-of-pocket expenses — but there are plenty of other fees required for a property purchase that you should be aware of before starting the process.</p>\n<p>\"Budget for down payment, closing costs, and other costs as early as possible,\" Lee advises. \"In addition to the 20 percent down payment (some lenders require less), origination fees are usually between 2 and 5 percent of the total loan amount, and it is crucial that you start saving early on, so you have enough cash to cover all mortgage-related payments, legal fees, as well as broker's commission by the time you are ready to close the deal.\"</p>\n<p>Don't forget about the <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/watch-out-for-these-5-last-minute-home-buying-costs?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">often-overlooked hidden costs</a> that'll pop up before you know it, like property taxes, insurance premiums, and any Homeowners Association (HOA) dues. Taxes and HOA dues vary, so be sure to ask for details. Obtain an insurance premium estimate from your insurance agent.</p>\n<p>It's important to figure all this out before committing to a property to ensure you can afford the entire scope of fees associated with it.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. Investigate the HOA to make sure you're compatible</h2>\n<p>Homeowners Associations can be great for many communities because they provide a set of standards to ensure that all residents are living in a place that values beautification and resale value. On the other hand, some folks find the HOA to be too involved, and the decisions of the board may not always be best for everyone. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-homeowners-associations?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What You Need to Know About Homeowners' Associations</a>)</p>\n<p>Robert Nordlund, founder and CEO of Association Reserves, explains.</p>\n<p>\"'Location' is certainly one of the most influential factors in the value of a real estate transaction, but when it comes to buying a home in one of the 350,000 association-governed communities (AGCs) in the United States, home-buyers face two additional circumstances,\" he says. \"First, getting a good value on the front end will be influenced by largely unpublicized financial factors unique to that AGC. Second, the long-term fate of their investment will be permanently hitched to the decisions or whims of a group of volunteer board members. The vetting process is not complicated, but it does take time and should be completed before any offer is on the table.\"</p>\n<p>To help you find the right HOA for you, consider these tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attend a board meeting.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>If the association is professionally managed, meet with the manager.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Check the association's annual budget and make sure it's accurate and balanced.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Ask for a copy of the Reserve Study and take the time to understand it.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Check the curb appeal closely in daylight and in the evening.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Make note of any obvious deferred maintenance.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Ask about the history of special assessments.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Evaluate the transparency of the board and manager.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Read the association's rules and standards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7. Buy a home below your means</h2>\n<p>Real estate expert, Julie Gurner, makes a case for spending the least amount possible on a home that meets your needs and makes you happy — even when you have plenty more to spend on it.</p>\n<p>\"While your friends might struggle to pay for something at the top of their budget, shoot for a home that is 75 percent or less of what you're approved for to be able to save more effectively for retirement, emergency repairs, travel, and generally enjoy your life far more without the fiscal burden,\" she says.</p>\n<p>How can you do that? Look for the most outdated home in the most desirable neighborhood.</p>\n<p>\"Look for a home where the style is outdated — it might need a new kitchen, there's likely old wallpaper or carpets — but it's well tended to and all the bones are solid,\" Gurner adds. \"With time and a bit of effort, the ugliest home on the block can almost always become your dream home. With so many people expecting move-in-ready homes, the outdated homes are often overlooked gems that can save you a fortune and put you in a position to build sweat equity from day one.\"</p>\n<h2>8. Invest remotely in high-yielding real estate markets</h2>\n<p>For home-buyers in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and many other coastal markets, purchasing affordable single-family rental (SFR) homes out-of-state is a great way to get started buying real estate and building long-term wealth.</p>\n<p>\"Buyers in these coastal areas can find higher yields and lower median home prices than they can in their own backyards,\" says Zach Evanish, who leads sales efforts at investment-property resource Roofstock. \"Some prime examples include Memphis, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, and other metros across the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest. Buying SFRs remotely can also be a stepping stone to amassing an investment real estate empire with ample positive monthly cash flow, and to eventually buying an owner-occupied home in one's own hometown, thanks to this stable stream of monthly rental income.\"</p>\n<h2>9. Ask for reductions after inspection</h2>\n<p>One of my own personal tactics for saving money on the homes I've purchased is taking advantage of an inspection that reveals interior or exterior issues. If the seller is in a depressed market or needs to sell quickly because of other circumstances, you have a great chance of making post-inspection deals.</p>\n<p>\"Home sellers often describe their property's condition as much better than it is. A good inspection often reveals unanticipated defects,\" explains Lucas Machado, president of House Heroes, a real estate investment company. \"Don't be afraid to ask for a reduction. Buyers sometimes hesitate to request a lower price due to fear of losing the house. In reality, sellers give plenty of reductions upon request — even tens of thousands below the initial offer. There is no downside to asking — and you can still proceed if they say no.\"</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

But for some people — especially those who don't have their financial ducks in a row — it's a time when panic sets in. </p>\n<p>After all, turning 40 can make you painfully aware that time is running out to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-financial-mistakes-you-need-to-stop-making-by-30?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fix any financial mistakes</a> you've made in the past. At the same time, you need to get serious about your money if you want to enjoy your golden years without financial stress. That's why financial advisers suggest a handful of money moves everyone should make before their 40th birthday.</p>\n<h2>1. Deal with consumer debt</h2>\n<p>Ryan Inman, a financial planner for doctors, says it's crucial to create a plan to deal with consumer debt well before your 40th birthday. That's especially true when it comes to high interest credit card debt. With the average credit card interest rate now over 17%, this type of debt can be difficult to pay off — and a big drain on your budget each month. </p>\n<p>If your goal is paying off debt, there are multiple approaches to consider. You can attack it the old-fashioned way and pay as much as you can each month, or even try <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-secrets-to-mastering-the-debt-snowball?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the debt snowball</a> or debt avalanche methods. You can even apply for a <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/fastest-way-to-pay-off-10000-in-credit-card-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">balance transfer credit card</a> that lets you secure 0% APR for up to 21 months. </p>\n<p>Ideally, you should strive to have no debt other than your mortgage at this point in your life, says Inman.</p>\n<p>While this may seem like a lofty goal, not having to make interest payments toward consumer debt will make it a lot easier to save more for retirement and play catch up on your investments if you're already behind.</p>\n<h2>2. Maximize your retirement savings</h2>\n<p>It's easy to think maxing out your retirement savings isn't necessary when you're young, but when your 40s hit, you become keenly aware of just how much more your nest egg needs to grow. </p>\n<p>Financial planner Benjamin Brandt, who hosts a retirement podcast called <em>Retirement Starts Today Radio</em>, says he suggests anyone approaching 40 start maxing out their retirement savings. Remember that you'll set your contributions up through payroll out of your pre-tax income, so it's not as costly as it may seem. Also note that contributing the max to retirement will reduce your taxable income, which could mean a smaller income tax bill this year. </p>\n<p>If you can't contribute the max, Brandt says to try to contribute more than you are now and inch your goal up slightly every year until you get there. </p>\n<p>Brandon Renfro, an assistant professor of finance and financial planner in Hallsville, Texas, says that, at the very least, you should make sure you're getting the full employer match on your retirement plan. An employer match is the amount of money your employer might match when you save for retirement yourself. For example, your employer might agree to contribute up to 6% of your income each year as a match, but you have to contribute 6% to get the full amount. </p>\n<p>Remember that your employer match is free money for the taking, and you should take advantage of any help you can get toward retirement savings as you approach your 40s.</p>\n<h2>3. Automate your finances</h2>\n<p>Certified Public Accountant Riley Adams, who also writes at Young and the Invested, says that your 40s are a good time to try to automate your investments if you haven't already. With more automation and money moving on its own, you're less likely to spend money on stuff you don't need or end up in a situation where you're inflating your lifestyle as your income grows.</p>\n<p>\"To protect yourself from yourself, learn to establish automated financial transactions to handle your money moves each paycheck,\" he says. \"Doing so takes the hassle out of your hands and also puts your money to better use.\" </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>For example, you could set up an automatic bank transfer so a specific amount of money is transferred to a high-yield savings account every month. Or, you can set up automatic deposits into a brokerage account. Boosting your retirement savings in a workplace account can also be considered automation since the money is taken out of your paycheck automatically and invested on your behalf.

Purchase insurance based on your future finances</h2>\n<p>Financial planner Brenton Harrison of Henderson Financial Group says that, by your 40th birthday, you should also have your insurance needs squared away. However, you should strive to think of your insurance needs in future tense. </p>\n<p>\"It's tempting to determine your needs based on your current income and net worth,\" he says. \"But for many people, their 40s are their peak earning years, meaning that the insurance needs you have before 40 might not be enough as your career progresses.\" </p>\n<p>Harrison suggests sitting down and thinking about where you'd like to go in your career and where you plan to be financially in 10 years. From there, buy insurance based on that financial picture. </p>\n<p>\"If you know you can and will achieve a certain level of success, don't wait until you've reached it to start planning,\" he says. </p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-other-kinds-of-insurance-you-may-need-to-buy-for-your-home?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">types of insurance you'll need</a> vary depending on your situation, think beyond the basics like homeowner's and auto insurance. For example, you may want to buy an umbrella insurance policy that extends your coverage limits in certain cases.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure to get proper life insurance coverage,\" says financial planner Luis Rosa. </p>\n<p>\"If you have a family or are planning on having one in the near future, it is crucial to make sure that they are protected,\" he says. And you're much more likely to qualify for the coverage you need at a price you can afford when you're in your 40s (or before) and still relatively healthy.</p>\n<h2>5. Build an emergency fund</h2>\n<p>If you've struggled with your finances over the years and dealt with credit card debt multiple times, chances are good it's because you don't have <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-easy-ways-to-build-an-emergency-fund-from-0?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an emergency fund</a>. While any amount saved is better than nothing, most experts suggest keeping a separate fund for emergency expenses or job loss that's stocked with three to six months of expenses or more.</p>\n<p>You never know what kind of roadblocks life will throw your way, but you'll be prepared for almost anything if you have savings set aside. And if you can't save six months of expenses, it's still best to start somewhere — even if you can only squirrel away a few thousand dollars.</p>\n<p>Put your savings in an interest-bearing account and keep adding to it, and you'll eventually get there.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

For all three of my children, I've bought quality baby items second-hand for less than half of their retail price, used them, and then resold them for what I paid (or more!) once I was done using them. This method has allowed me to have everything on my baby list and lower the cost of having a baby.</p>\n<p>You can find good quality baby items at thrift stores, garage sales, and consignment shops to make the most profit. Once you're done with an item, sell clothing on a site like eBay, and sell bigger items, like baby gear, on Craigslist, OfferUp, consignment shops, or local Facebook groups. Here are eight baby items with the highest resale value. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/what-a-new-baby-really-needs?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What a New Baby Really Needs</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Name-brand baby clothes</h2>\n<p>I once found a baby Burberry outfit for $0.99 at the thrift store. I resold it within 24 hours for $75 on eBay. The right baby clothes can fetch a pretty penny. Look for popular brands like Baby Gap, Janie and Jack, Gymboree, and OshKosh for less than $1 a piece to resell. Selling a lot of the same brand in the same size can earn you more money than selling each piece separately. Boutique brands like Hanna Andersson, Naartjie, and Kickee Pants sell for even more when they're in sets and in excellent condition.</p>\n<h2>2. Halloween costumes</h2>\n<p>New parents are more likely to spend more money on their baby's first and second Halloween costumes than the ones that follow, because those are exciting ages to celebrate Halloween in something that's brand new and extremely cute.</p>\n<p>If you purchased a costume for your baby from Gymboree, Gap, and Disney, you can resell them and make some decent cash. You can also look for these brands at thrift stores in October, and buy costumes for up to 90 percent off the week after Halloween in retail stores to resell. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/15-ways-to-make-money-on-halloween?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15 Ways to Make Money on Halloween</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Strollers</h2>\n<p>Parents are willing to spend a lot of money on name-brand strollers, especially if they're double or triple strollers. Look for brands like <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EvZpCW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bugaboo</a>, Baby Jogger, Britax, and BOB strollers, since they hold their resale value well. Potential sellers are very interested in the year a stroller was made, so be sure to stick to recent models to make an easy sale.</p>\n<p>Along with strollers, stroller accessories are also a hot item. Brand-name trays and attachments are easy to store and can fetch a decent price if kept in good condition.</p>\n<h2>4. Specialty items</h2>\n<p>The key to cashing in on baby specialty items is to stay on top of baby trends. Specialty baby items like a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Em37yj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DockATot baby lounger</a> or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Lg9STx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Owlet baby monitor</a> are at the top of many baby must-have lists at the moment. If you can find these items for 70 to 90 percent off their retail value, then you can make a quick profit.</p>\n<h2>5. High-end maternity items</h2>\n<p>Most maternity clothes and pillows aren't ideal for reselling. However, expensive name-brand maternity clothes, especially dresses and jeans, are easier to resell. You can determine which maternity brands and items sell best by searching the sold items on eBay. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-smart-ways-to-save-on-maternity-clothes?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Smart Ways to Save on Maternity Clothes</a>)</p>\n<h2>6. Large baby gear</h2>\n<p>Most parents are desperate to sell large baby gear for next to nothing because it takes up too much space in their home or garage. You can find walkers, bouncers, high chairs, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LhPWzS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bumbo floor seats</a>, and more for $3–$5 each at yard sales and local online sales and flip them for $25–$60, depending on the quality of the item and brand.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>7. Book sets</h2>\n<p>Baby books are easy to find for a quarter or two at yard sales or thrift shops. While you won't make a sizable profit on one book, you can make a good amount on a series of books. Some popular baby books to look for are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QVVZPT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sandra Boynton board books</a>, Dr. Seuss' board books, Dr. Seuss' hardcover books, and all of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rynVe0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eric Carle's books</a>. Sell them in lots to earn the most money for them, and even pair them with matching stuffed animals or puppets if you can. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/15-unexpected-expenses-of-a-new-baby?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15 Unexpected Expenses of a New Baby</a>)</p>\n<h2>8. Baby carriers</h2>\n<p>Baby carriers like <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QNenKr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ergobaby</a>, TwinGo, Tula, and the Solly Baby Wrap all resell well. These baby carriers in specialty designs can also earn more money than standard colors.</p>\n<p>When looking for brand-name carriers, be sure to stay up-to-date on the newest models. For example, Ergobaby released a 360 carrier, so parents can carry their babies forward-facing safely. This means there is a greater demand for this model than Ergobaby's older models.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Many people try and fail, or they succeed only to become ensnared the vicious cycle over and over again. Eliminating debt takes lots of grit and determination, and strategically attacking your debt will save you time, energy, and money.</p>\n<p>Before you get started, you should know that each type of debt requires a slightly different strategy. Here's how to tackle different types of debt, and get rid of it once and for all.</p>\n<h2>Credit card debt</h2>\n<p>The best way to attack credit card debt is by using the <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-secrets-to-mastering-the-debt-snowball?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">debt snowball</a>. With this method, you begin by attacking the smallest debt while paying the minimum on everything else. Once one debt is paid, you take all the money you were paying on the first card and apply it to the second biggest balance. Rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>You may be tempted to attack them based on interest rate, which is also known as the debt avalanche. And that will work. However, you must keep in mind that debt is more mental than it is logical. You probably didn't use a ton of logic to get into debt. And logic won't inspire you to get out of debt. The debt snowball approach allows you to get quick wins by conquering smaller debts before taking on the larger ones, which require more time and patience. Winning becomes a contagious habit that helps you build momentum.</p>\n<p>You also may want to contact your credit card companies and request that they lower your interest rate. Some will and some won't, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

However, they follow the same principle for repayment. First, make sure you understand the repayment terms and then contact the lender and ask them to reduce your interest rate.</p>\n<p>In addition to using the debt snowball, a great repayment strategy for this type of debt is to call the lending agency and set up bi-weekly payments instead of paying monthly. The minimum payment doesn't change, you just make 26 payments a year versus 12. This lowers the total amount of interest you will pay over the life of the loan. When you pay more than the minimum payment, you'll slash months — even years — off the total repayment time.</p>\n<h2>Student loans</h2>\n<p>Despite how it may feel, paying off student loans is possible. You just need some discipline, patience, and a plan. For most folks, student loan debt is one of the most significant debts owed — second only to a mortgage.</p>\n<p>The first thing you want to do is determine the total amount owed. You can do this by visiting the National Student Loan Data System or contacting your lender. From there, visit the <a href=\"https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Student Loan Website</a> to see if your loans can be consolidated, if your interest rate can be lowered, and if you qualify for any loan forgiveness programs. The <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Education</a> offers eight different repayment plans that may be able to assist you if you're considered low income or have special circumstances. They also provide repayment calculators and a host of other information and resources that can assist you in repaying your loans quicker.</p>\n<p>Once you know the total amount owed, and have found a repayment plan that works for you, it's time to get busy. You want to throw ever extra dollar you have at this debt and make multiple payments a month, if possible.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Mortgage</h2>\n<p>The term \"mortgage,\" translated from old French, literally means \"death pledge.\" How fitting. There are several schools of thought on whether you should pay off your home early. For some people paying it off early makes sense, for others it doesn't. If you do want to knock the mortgage off your debt list, there are a few things you can do to expedite repayment.</p>\n<h3>Make bi-weekly payments</h3>\n<p>By simply splitting your monthly mortgage payment into equal parts where it's paid every two weeks, you can shave years of payments off a 30-year mortgage. If you pay more than the minimum, you expedite the process even more. You'll have to make arrangements with the lending institution to set up a bi-weekly payment plan and ensure that the extra money is applied directly to the principal.</p>\n<h3>Making one additional mortgage payment a year</h3>\n<p>This impacts the mortgage the same way making bi-weekly payments does. It's just done in one lump sum instead of over the course of a year. When you make the extra payment, you must specify that you would like it applied directly to the principal.</p>\n<h3>Make lump sum payments periodically</h3>\n<p>If you don't feel you have the ability to make bi-weekly payments or make one large additional mortgage payment, you can still pay extra on the mortgage as you are able. Paying an extra hundred dollars a few times a year will drastically speed up the repayment process. Every little bit helps.</p>\n<h3>Refinance from a 30-year fixed to a 15-year fixed</h3>\n<p>This may not make sense for everyone, but it is worth considering. By the time you're ready to begin aggressively paying off your home, you will have eliminated all other debt. You can afford to pay more. And your credit score will have gotten better and will allow you to refinance at a much lower interest rate. This strategy can cut the repayment time down by more than half.</p>\n<h2>But first, create an emergency fund</h2>\n<p>The quickest way to derail your debt repayment efforts is to have an unexpected expense. And you will have plenty. <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-fast-ways-to-restock-an-emergency-fund-after-an-emergency?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Establishing an emergency fund</a> before you begin paying down debt is one of the keys to success. Having a few thousand dollars set aside just for emergencies will keep you on track, keep you from incurring new debt and do wonders for your psyche.</p>\n<p>If you do have an emergency and have to use some of the money, you simply pause your debt repayment plan to replace what you spent. Use the extra funds you were applying to your debt to replenish your emergency fund. Once it's restocked, you go back to attacking the debt.

We no longer have to hold yard sales every week, or pay for classified ads in newspapers. With eBay, Amazon, Etsy, Craigslist, and so many other outlets available, you have the world at your fingertips. But of course, the more open you are to sellers, the more accessible you are to scammers. Know what to watch out for, and you can sell your stuff with minimal stress.

Don't accept big bills</h2>\n<p>If you're selling on Craigslist, you have to be very careful with cash transactions. Something scammers love to do is present a fake $50 or $100 bill, and take home an item along with a bunch of change. The seller is left holding a worthless note and down a valuable possession. One way to keep this kind of damage to a minimum is to only take $20 bills and below.</p>\n<p>However, $20 bills can be fake as well, so you have to keep your wits about you. There are many ways to detect fake notes, and if the bill has blurry text and lines, no watermark, you likely have a fake. If you're in no mood to become a detective, pick up a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TUHFFG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fake note detector kit</a>. It costs less than $10 and will pay for itself the first time you detect a phony bill.

Always meet your buyer in a public place</h2>\n<p>It may be inconvenient for you to meet in a police station parking lot or at a local coffee shop, but your first priority here has to be your personal safety. You have no idea who you're meeting and what they have in mind, even if they sound wonderful via email or over the phone. Some \"buyers\" lure you in to steal your item, and whatever else you have on you. Some want to cause you physical harm, or worse, and have no intention of purchasing anything. If you ask to meet in a public place and they refuse, that's a massive red flag. If they want you to bring the item to an address of their choosing, you also need to steer clear of that transaction. If you can, bring a friend (or friends) and tell other people where you're going and all the details about the person you're meeting. Most of the time, it's just a regular person looking for a deal. But you really don't want to let your guard down and trust the wrong person.</p>\n<h2>3. Have evidence of the item's condition</h2>\n<p>Many people abuse the good will of online sellers to save money. One of the nastiest ways you can be taken advantage of is when someone buys a mint condition item from you, then asks for a return and a refund because \"it doesn't work.\"</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>For example, let's say someone buys a high-end computer mouse from you, then they say it doesn't work and want a refund. You know it worked fine when you sold it. If it's something that costs more than just a few bucks, have evidence of the item working in the listing itself. Take accurate photos and videos, and record serial numbers. It takes just a few minutes to get this all down, and you only have to store it until the transaction is closed and everyone is happy.

Avoid buyers with brand new accounts</h2>\n<p>This is not to say that all buyers with new accounts are scammers. This is simply a precaution you should take to avoid getting stung. Scammers tend to get banned by eBay after a few incidents that form a pattern of fraudulent behavior. These people will just keep opening new accounts, doing a few returns for broken items, or \"item not as described\" before being banned again and continuing the cycle. Luckily, you don't have to weed these buyers out on your own. eBay has settings that let you block certain buyers.

Be wary of requests for partial refunds</h2>\n<p>So, you sold your item and everything seems fine. Then you get an email from the buyer, saying that the item isn't in the condition they were expecting, or it's missing some parts — which you know were included. But they want to keep the item. They'd just like you to refund their money to make things right. If you're asked to do a partial refund, try and get evidence of the problem. If it's damaged, ask to see the damage. If it doesn't work as described, ask for a video. If they refuse, you know something's afoot.</p>\n<p>If they do send pictures, you have a few choices. You can say you want the item to be returned, and will fully refund their purchase upon receipt. If they don't want to do that, they're probably trying to get a quick buck from you. Of course, sometimes these partial refund requests are genuine, perhaps due to an inaccurate listing from a new seller, or another mistake. In that case, a partial refund is something you can issue if you feel comfortable.</p>\n<h2>6. Never ship to a different address than the one on file</h2>\n<p>When you set up an account on an online selling site, you should enter a shipping and billing address. This is standard practice. If you sell an item, and receive a note asking that you ship to a different address, you should decline. On rare occasions, the person hasn't updated their shipping address from a move, or it's a gift for someone else. Too bad. Don't do it.</p>\n<p>When you're asked to ship to a different address, it could be that the account in question has been hacked, or you will be asked for a refund because the item was not delivered to the address on file. It's just not worth it.

Can collection agencies legally do this?</p>\n<p>The answer is a bit complicated.</p>\n<p>The types of calls that debt collectors can make is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission's <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text#805\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a>. This act provides protection to consumers who owe debts. It says, for instance, that debt collectors can't threaten you with jail time or call you early in the morning or late at night. The act also says that collectors can't call you multiple times a day. The act also regulates the communication that debt collectors can have with your family members. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-things-debt-collectors-dont-want-you-to-know?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Things Debt Collectors Don't Want You to Know</a>)</p>\n<h2>Calling family members</h2>\n<p>Debt collectors are hired to get you to pay up the money you owe to their clients. To do this, they'll reach out to you by mail or phone to convince you to come up with the cash. But if debt collectors can't find you? Then they can contact your family members. In fact, they can contact anyone who knows you, including friends or co-workers.</p>\n<p>However, what they can say to these third parties, and how often they can contact them, is extremely limited. The Fair Debt Collections Practices Act states that debt collectors can only contact family members, friends, or co-workers to find your location. If they have already contacted you, they are not allowed to reach out to others. They can also only contact family members or friends once.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>What they can say</h2>\n<p>Debt collectors are also limited in what they can say to your family members. They must identify themselves and state that they are confirming your contact information or looking for correct contact information. If your family members ask, they are required to identify who is employing them, but only if they are expressly asked this question.</p>\n<p>Debt collectors are not allowed to tell family members that you owe any debt. Collectors also can't threaten family members or call them more than once unless the debt collector reasonably believes that the family member's earlier responses were incorrect or incomplete, and that the person now has correct or complete info.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/can-debt-collectors-tell-other-people-like-family-friends-or-my-employer-about-my-debt-en-332/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> says that debt collectors can't discuss your debt with anyone besides you, your spouse, or your attorney — if that attorney is representing you regarding your debt. If you're a minor, debt collectors can speak with your parents about your debt. They can also discuss your debt with your guardian, executor, or administrator, if you have them.</p>\n<h2>What to do if debt collectors aren't following the rules?</h2>\n<p>If debt collectors are violating the rules of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act when they contact your family members, you should contact the Federal Trade Commission with your complaint. You can file a complaint online by using the commission's <a href=\"https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&amp;panel1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Complaint Assistant</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also contact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You can file a <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">complaint online</a> with this this agency, too.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have the option of suing a debt collection agency in state court or small claims court. Be warned, though. You might have to hire an attorney to succeed, and this can be a time-consuming and frustrating challenge.

But the news is even worse in some states like Alaska, New Mexico, and Louisiana, according to an analysis of credit card debt from creditcards.com. Consumers in these three states carried an average of $10,685, $8,323, and $8,110 in credit card debt, respectively, as of 2017.</p>\n<p>This is unfortunate, but it's not completely unexpected. It's easy to lean too hard on a credit card when you face a job loss or a loss in income, and high interest rates don't help matters much. The average credit card today carries an APR of well over 17%. With so much interest charged on revolving credit card debt, it's difficult to make a dent in the principal of your balance. This often leaves people languishing in debt for years, and even racking up more debt over time.</p>\n<p>Consumers use many strategies to get out of debt, one of which involves applying for balance transfer cards. With a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">balance transfer card</a>, you qualify for 0% APR for a limited time — usually 12 to 21 months. However, you're normally required to pay a balance transfer fee of 3% or 5% of your balance, and the introductory offer won't last forever.</p>\n<p>Some people use balance transfer cards to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/fastest-way-to-pay-off-10000-in-credit-card-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">successfully pay down debt</a> at 0% APR, but others simply make the minimum payments and never make real progress against their debts. Those consumers usually end up exactly where they started once their card's introductory offer ends — with plenty of debt and a crushing APR.</p>\n<p>There may be a better, more predictable way out of debt, however, and it involves a personal loan. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-times-personal-loans-may-be-better-than-credit-cards?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Times Personal Loans May Be Better than Credit Cards</a>)</p>\n<h2>How a personal loan can help you climb out of debt</h2>\n<p>Applying for a new loan to work your way out of debt may go against the grain of common sense, but there are plenty of reasons a personal loan can work. For starters, personal loans come with low fixed interest rates that never change — even as low as 4.9% APR for consumers with good credit. Second, personal loans have fixed repayment schedules that tell you exactly when you'll become debt-free.</p>\n<p>Because personal loans have fixed rates and fixed repayment terms, you also have a fixed monthly payment that stays the same. This is much different from the way credit cards work since your payment will change based on your APR and how much you owe.</p>\n<p>With a personal loan to pay down debt, you know <em>exactly </em>what you're getting into. You know how much you'll need to pay each month, when your loan will be paid off, and what your interest rate will be the entire time. The best part is, a personal loan is not a line of credit you can borrow against. So once you use your loan proceeds to pay off and consolidate your credit card bills, you won't have the option to use your loan to rack up more debt.

But you'll be in the best position to help yourself if you go about repayment the right way.</p>\n<h3>Compare personal loan offers</h3>\n<p>Personal loans are offered by large financial institutions like banks and credit unions as well as several online lenders. Because there are so many options to get a personal loan, your first step is shopping around to compare offers in terms of their interest rates and fees.</p>\n<p>The best personal loans come without an origination fee, any application fees, or hidden fees.

Select the type of loan you’re looking for, the amount, your credit rating and state, to see the best options available for you.</p>\n<h3>Create a spending plan</h3>\n<p>Once you've shopped for a personal loan, you'll have an idea of your new monthly payment. At that point, it's crucial to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-steps-to-successful-budgeting?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create a monthly budget or spending plan</a> to ensure you can stay on top of your new loan.</p>\n<p>Sit down with your bank statements and figure out exactly how much you earn and how much you owe, including your new personal loan, housing costs, and other bills. From there, you should look for ways to reduce your spending. That may mean dining out less often, cutting cable for a while, or going on a spending freeze. Whatever you do, make sure you have a grasp on how much you can afford to spend each month while keeping up with all your expenses.</p>\n<h3>Stop using credit cards</h3>\n<p>Finally, don't forget that you have to stop using credit cards! The importance of this step cannot be overstated.</p>\n<p>Paying off your credit card debt with a personal loan can put you in a precarious position where you're tempted to start using credit cards again. But if you start using credit, you'll likely rack up even more debt balances you'll have to pay off.</p>\n<p>Your best bet is putting your credit cards away for safekeeping and sticking to cash or debit instead. To get out of debt — and stay out of debt — you must learn to live within your means. Not using credit cards is the only way to ensure you're living a lifestyle you can actually afford.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Know your travelers' needs.</strong></p>\n<p>Talking to your employees about their travel needs is one of the best ways to keep costs down. This doesn't just include selecting smoking vs. non-smoking, or aisle seat vs. window, but rather asking your road warriors “what do you really need to feel comfortable traveling?” You may find that certain employees don’t care for a king-sized bed or wouldn't mind taking a red-eye flight so that they can return home to family earlier.</p>\n<p>Prepare a simple travel questionnaire for each employee to fill out. Ask them what their preferences are by priority and have it on hand when making their travel arrangements. In addition to standard questions regarding flight seating, bed size, and rental car preferences, be sure to include detailed preferences such as dining choices, special health or disability accommodations, and even whether they like rooms on the first or fiftieth floor (some travelers feel more secure in rooms off the main level).</p>\n<p>By giving each employee this simple “needs” analysis, you will save money on things the employee didn't care about while maximizing their comfort (and efficiency) while away from home.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Save your resources for when it counts.</strong></p>\n<p>Before a trip is ever booked, talk with your team to decide whether the trip is really necessary. Meetings that can easily take place via conference call or web interface should almost always happen in-house.  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/voice/about\">Google Voice</a> and <a href=\"http://www.skype.com/\">Skype</a> are low-cost video-conferencing options that work well.</p>\n<p>However, if the trip has the potential to produce an on-site contract signing or another major milestone, the investment should be made. There is no substitution for the candor and connection that results from grabbing a drink or a quick bite to eat with a would-be client.</p>\n<p>By betting on only the best opportunities, you can keep your team sleeping in their own beds more often.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Let the team know what's going on.</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone is feeling the economy, and while it may be acceptable to give a blanket “we are putting you in coach because we need to save money” excuse, providing even a bit more of an explanation can put you in the good graces of your employees.</p>\n<p>Your team needs to be assured that their comfort and safety will always come first. For each cut in the budget you make, explain your reasoning to the team.  If a switch in hotel vendors is made, give an adult explanation to why it’s being done and how the change can positively affect pay and benefits.</p>\n<p>Putting the cuts in a “team-oriented” light will bring a sense of unity to those most affected by cuts. If the CEO is also expected to fly coach, middle-managers will be more likely to swallow it easily.   Remember that these are capable adults being sent out to represent your brand and mission, not kids being shuttled off to day camp.  The level of respect you provide will directly equate to higher morale, better sales, and a more loyal workforce.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Take advantage of corporate discounts.</strong></p>\n<p>If you don’t already have a group rate set up with the hotel or rental car chain that you use the most, this is the perfect opportunity to ask for a discount.  Many companies offer details on their website, but a simple call to their corporate office can get you going in the right direction. Discounts can vary from getting a small percentage (5-10%) off all your bookings, to getting a free night or day rental after a certain number of purchases.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Utilize credit and charge card rewards.</strong></p>\n<p>And pass travel rewards back to employees.  Have a chance to upgrade a seat from coach to business class using reward points?  Do it, and get your road warrior to their destination happier. There are also cards that give you <span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">access to airline lounges or business lounges in cities around the world. These comfortable lounges offer your jet-lagged road warrior a place to work and freshen up all over the world.  Plus some cards offer exclusive access to events, impossible-to-get dining reservations, and access to premium concierge service.</span></p>\n<p>Use all the rewards you have to make life easier for your traveling employee (especially amidst cutbacks in other areas).</p>\n<p><strong>6. Plan ahead.</strong></p>\n<p>Cancelling a trip on last-minute’s notice is not only inconvenient, but it can also be very costly.  Airline change fees start around $150, and many hotels will charge for nights canceled within 24 hours of the reservation.  If you find that cancellations are eating up even a small amount of your travel budget, it may be time to revaluate the common causes for these travel snags and get them under control via the communication methods mentioned above.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Mind your time.</strong></p>\n<p>Money can be lost when travel time is not clearly specified.  Will your sales team be gone three hours or six?  Can they return that night or do they need to stay until the next afternoon? Small decisions can balloon into big expenses. By finding out just how much time the trip really needs to take, you can cut back on time out of the office (and money out of your pocket).</p>\n<p><strong>8.

There are many people who might have an impressive degree and can do calculus, but when it comes to public speaking or cooking a tasty meal, they don't know where to begin. Here are seven basic life skills everyone needs to know, and how to learn them for free.</p>\n<h2>1. Budgeting</h2>\n<p>Rather than learning basic personal finance skills in school, many of us have had to learn financial lessons through costly trial and error. Learning to stick with a budget means you can avoid and pay off debt, save for retirement, and eventually be able to buy a home or splurge on a dream vacation.</p>\n<p>There are several <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/boost-your-savings-with-this-easy-budgeting-system?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">budgeting techniques you can use</a>, but essentially you want to start tracking all of your bills and expenses, and ultimately see where you can cut back. Then move those extra funds to paying off debt or into a savings account. Keeping all of this information in one place like a spreadsheet will be your best bet in being able to get a clear picture of your finances. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/take-control-of-your-money-with-these-10-free-spreadsheet-templates?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Take Control of Your Money With These 10 Free Spreadsheet Templates</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Public speaking</h2>\n<p>Even though many will not choose a career that requires constant speeches, like a pastor or politician, all of us will need to speak publicly at some point. Whether it be for a work meeting, a wedding speech, or a eulogy at a funeral, you'll have to get up in front of a group of people and not pass out from nerves.</p>\n<p>You can audit the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/public-speaking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">University of Washington’s public speaking course</a> through Coursera for free, or rent books with tips on how to master this skill from your local library. You could even practice monologues in front of a mirror or for a group of friends.</p>\n<h2>3. Speed reading</h2>\n<p>Reading at a faster speed while maintaining comprehension can help you enjoy more books in less time. And depending on your line of work, it can also help you perform your work tasks at a quicker speed (and hopefully getting a bigger raise).</p>\n<p>There are a few free speed reading courses through Skillshare and other free education platforms. One notable course on Skillshare is <a href=\"https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Speed-Reading-Mastery-Double-Your-Reading-Speed-In-7-Days/1488233306?via=browse-rating-speed-reading-layout-grid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Speed Reading Mastery</a> from Jordan Harry, a TEDx speaker who says he can read 1,500 words per minute. Skillshare does have a monthly fee of $15, but you can get the first month for free and take unlimited classes during that introductory period.</p>\n<h2>4. Speaking a second language</h2>\n<p>If mastering a second language is on your bucket list, then stop waiting for enough free time to get started. You can learn a new language by committing to 15-30 minutes a day with free audiobooks from the library or free online courses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Duolingo</a> is one of the most popular free language platforms and gamifies the learning process to make it more enjoyable. There are many languages offered, including Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. There is even an option to learn High Valyrian from <em>Game of Thrones</em> or Klingon from <em>Star Trek</em>. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/11-ways-a-second-language-can-boost-your-career?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11 Ways a Second Language Can Boost Your Career</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Cooking</h2>\n<p>There are so many elements to cooking, but everyone should feel comfortable enough in the kitchen to whip up a tasty meal with ingredients they have on hand. When you can look in your pantry and fridge and turn staples into dinner, you won’t be constantly tempted to order takeout.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Jamie Oliver has several YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpSgg_ECBj25s9moCDfSTsA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">videos on kitchen basics</a>, such as roasting a chicken or making perfect scrambled eggs, along with how to make classic dishes like spaghetti carbonara. Once you've mastered the basics in the kitchen, take it to the next level with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIEv3lZ_tNXHzL3ox-_uUGQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gordon Ramsay’s YouTube lessons</a>. And since you're not a contestant on <em>Hell's Kitchen</em>, you won't get yelled at if you make a mistake.</p>\n<h2>6. Sewing</h2>\n<p>Just learning the basics of sewing can save you tons of money because you'll be able to repair minor rips, reattach buttons, and even hem pants that are too long, instead of buying new clothing items all the time. You'll also be equipped to adjust your clothes or your children’s clothes during weight fluctuations or growth spurts.</p>\n<p>The internet is full of free sewing tutorials and patterns, but a good starting place is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRE4TABLswU&amp;list=PLSCF3Ro7iAmTBBiNhxERf7ZqFEDAeqI-z\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Made Everyday’s sewing lessons</a> on YouTube.</p>\n<h2>7. Writing</h2>\n<p>You don’t need to learn how to become the next best-selling author, but you do need to learn how to get your point across with the written word. A well-written letter or email can save you money on your bills, land you a job, soothe a family or friend conflict, or help you do better in the workplace.

It's just gone. One theory is that we accidentally donated it to Goodwill, since she had stored it in an old book and we'd been clearing out a lot of junk. But it got me thinking: <em>What would be a better place to keep money she's not using?</em></p>\n<p>She's been bringing in some respectable allowance earnings with the chores she's taken on recently. Plus, she always receives some money for birthdays, and she doesn't spend much. Maybe an investment account?</p>\n<p>While the investing rules are a little different for minors compared to adults, it's not hard to get your child started investing. Even if they only make a little money, the experience may encourage them to start investing for retirement early in adulthood, which can set them up for life. Here's how to show your kid the basics of investing.</p>\n<h2>Determine what kind of account to set up</h2>\n<p>Children can set up savings, checking, or brokerage accounts using the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) or the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA). All they need is an adult (presumably you) to sign on as the account's custodian. This means you have to approve what your child does with the money until your kid is of age, which is 18 or 21, depending on what state you live in. Because the funds or investments in a UTMA legally belong to your child, once they're in this account, they can only be spent for your child's benefit. You can't deposit $100 in your child's UTMA account and later decide you want it back or transfer it to another child.</p>\n<p>Setting up a UTMA account is much like setting up any other account. You can walk into a bank or credit union and open one for your child by filling out some paperwork and showing your identification, or you can go online to sign up for one with a firm such as Vanguard.</p>\n<p>Your child could also set up a UTMA <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-creative-uses-for-a-529-plan?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">529 savings plan</a>. The 529 is a college savings vehicle that has tax advantages, but also comes with restrictions on how it can be spent. More on that below.</p>\n<p>Aside from a traditional brokerage account, your child could also try a micro-investing account, since they're likely to be starting with a small amount of money. You can set up a custodial account through <a href=\"https://stashinvest.com/custodial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stash</a> or <a href=\"https://www.stockpile.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stockpile</a> — in fact, Stockpile even works with <a href=\"https://busykid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BusyKid</a>, an app that helps families track kids' chores and pay their allowances digitally.</p>\n<p>Besides an investment account, you may also need to open a checking or money market UTMA for your child and link it to the brokerage account, as a way to fund the brokerage account and a place to receive dividends and other proceeds.</p>\n<p>Unless they have earned income from working, your kids can't set up a traditional or Roth individual retirement account. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/9-essential-personal-finance-skills-to-teach-your-kid-before-they-move-out?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9 Essential Personal Finance Skills to Teach Your Kid Before They Move Out</a>)</p>\n<h2>Figure out what investment vehicles to use</h2>\n<p>Once their account is set up, kids have access to the same investment products that adults do, such as mutual funds, individual stocks, or exchange-traded funds. Which products they choose depends on their interests, how much money they have to start with, and how actively they wish to invest.</p>\n<p>A child who is interested in following one or more companies in the news and making active investment choices may want to buy individual stocks. Look for a brokerage firm with no minimum initial deposit (or a low one) and low trade fees. While this is a concrete and exciting way to start understanding the stock market, make sure that kids understand that for the long haul, many financial advisers recommend investing in funds over individual stocks.</p>\n<p>If your child doesn't have any individual companies in mind, but would like to invest in the market as a whole, a mutual fund such as an S&amp;P 500 index fund is a great way to go. Good ones have low expenses, meaning that your kid gets to keep more of his/her investment. Unfortunately, mutual funds do tend to require minimum investments. For instance, to buy shares in Charles Schwab's often-recommended S&amp;P 500 index fund, you need to open a Schwab brokerage account with a $1,000 initial deposit. However, there is one way around that: You can also open a Schwab account with a $100 deposit — but you have to deposit an additional $100 each month until the account has a $1,000 balance.</p>\n<p>Your child could also buy exchange-traded funds, which work a lot like mutual funds but tend to have <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-start-investing-with-just-100?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lower minimum investments</a>.</p>\n<p>Another way to get started with a small initial investment is to use one of the micro-investing apps mentioned above, which split one share of stock or of an ETF and sells the investor a fraction of it. These apps can make getting started very simple for young kids by characterizing investments by category. In exchange for making things this simple for you, these services usually charge a monthly fee; Stash's is $1 per month.</p>\n<p>While your child could also opt to invest in Treasury bonds or certificates of deposit, at today's low interest rates, this probably wouldn't be a very exciting way for them to learn about investing.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>What about taxes?</h2>\n<p>Does your child have to pay taxes on their investment gains? Do they have to file their own tax return? The answer to both questions is, \"It depends.\"</p>\n<p>If your child's investment income is less than $1,050, don't worry about it; you don't need to report this to the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/publications/p929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Internal Revenue Service</a>. If the child's investment income is less than $12,000, the parent can opt to report it on their own tax return, or file a separate return for the child. At more than $12,000, you have to file a tax return for your child.</p>\n<p>What rate will your kid pay? Unearned income up to $2,100 will get taxed at between 0 percent and 10 percent, depending on what kind of income it is. After that, your child's unearned income will be taxed at your rate, no matter if you file separately or together. So don't imagine that you can save a bundle on taxes by transferring all your investment accounts to your kids — the IRS caught on to that gambit years ago.</p>\n<p>If your child chose to put their money in a UTMA 529 plan, they <a href=\"https://irs.gov/newsroom/529-plans-questions-and-answers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">never have to pay federal taxes</a> (and generally not state taxes either) on the earnings, as long as they spend it on qualifying educational expenses, such as tuition and textbooks.</p>\n<h2>Will investing hurt their chances of getting college aid?</h2>\n<p>It's important to note that when it's time to apply for college financial aid, <a href=\"https://wisebread.com/12-surprising-ways-to-get-more-college-financial-aid?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assets in the child's name count against them</a> more than assets in the parents' name. Unless you're sure your family won't qualify for financial aid — and outside of the 1 percent, that's not usually something you can be sure of in advance — encourage your child to choose shorter-term goals for their investment account. They could choose a goal of anything from buying a new Lego set, to a week of sleep-away camp, to their first car.</p>\n<p>Again, putting their investments in a 529 plan changes the situation a bit. Even if the child is the account owner, the financial aid officers consider assets in a 529 account a parental asset.

But having easy access to credit also means it’s easy to overspend — something you just couldn’t do when paying with cash. You can end up with a mountain of debt that can take years or even decades to pay off. </p>\n<p>One kind of credit card may be more likely to set you up for success, and this type of card can even help you save money on interest if you're struggling with debt already. <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Balance transfer credit cards</a>, which can also be called 0% APR credit cards, actually let you avoid paying interest altogether for a limited time. </p>\n<p>Two main strategies can help you get ahead with this type of credit card, but only if you use plastic with a plan and stay disciplined in your approach. </p>\n<h2>Earn rewards on a big purchase</h2>\n<p>If you want to make a big purchase and pay it off slowly without having to pay interest, you should check out 0% APR credit cards that let you skip interest payments <em>and </em>earn rewards for each dollar you spend. This type of card typically works well if you need to pay for new appliances for your kitchen, a major home upgrade or repair, or even a semester of college. By charging the large purchase to your 0% APR credit card, you may be able to earn an initial sign-up or welcome bonus as well as rewards as a percentage of your spending. </p>\n<p>Of course, there are plenty of rewards credit cards that also dole out big initial bonuses and ongoing rewards while letting you avoid paying interest for up to 21 months. Make sure to compare rewards and <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-cash-back-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cash back credit cards</a> to see which ones might work best for whatever it is you need to buy and pay down slowly over time. </p>\n<h2>Consolidate high-interest debt</h2>\n<p>If you have a lot of debt at high interest rates, you can also get ahead with a 0% APR credit card — provided you stop spending and start focusing on debt repayment instead. Balance transfer credit cards often let you secure 0% APR on balance transfers for up to 21 months, although some do charge a 3% or 5% balance transfer fee for the privilege. Even if you do pay a balance transfer fee, however, the interest savings can far outweigh the fee.</p>\n<p>If you're against paying a fee to transfer high interest balances over, you can look for cards that waive this fee for a limited time. </p>\n<h2>How to choose a 0% APR credit card</h2>\n<p>Whether you want to pay down a large purchase without interest or save money by consolidating high interest debt at 0% APR, it's crucial to make sure you wind up with a new credit card that offers the perks you want. Here's everything you need to look for as you decide.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>0% APR offers that give you the time you need</h3>\n<p>If you want to pay off a large purchase over time or consolidate debt at 0% APR, you'll need to make sure you have enough time to pay off your debt entirely. Definitely compare 0% APR offers to see which ones give you plenty of time to accomplish your goal. If you don't, you'll wind up paying off debt at the standard variable APR, which will likely be very high. </p>\n<h3>Don't pick a card that might entice you to overspend</h3>\n<p>If you're really trying to pay off debt, stay away from cards that offer big sign-up bonuses within the first few months. You should use your <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/your-comprehensive-checklist-for-a-successful-balance-transfer?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">balance transfer credit card</a> to save money on interest, but don't use it for everyday spending. </p>\n<h3>Make sure to take fees into account</h3>\n<p>Most 0% APR credit cards don't charge an annual fee, but you should still compare balance transfer fees and other potential fees you may be charged such as late fees and over-limit fees.</p>\n<h3>Compare rewards programs</h3>\n<p>Finally, make sure you check out rewards programs if you want to rack up points on a large purchase. Some cards only let you redeem rewards for gift cards or cash back, whereas others let you cash in points for travel or transfers to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-credit-cards-that-transfer-points-to-airline-miles?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">airline and hotel partners</a>.

Each seat in my preferred section cost $84, which was a little high, but I figured it was worth it to see someone who consistently makes me laugh. But after adding in the service charge, taxes, and a fee to email the tickets to me, the two $84 tickets came to a total of just over $200.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has recently bought tickets to a music, sporting, or comedy event has had a similar experience. Hidden fees increase the price of your seat, but you won't even realize until it's time to enter in your payment information. At that point, you're already excited about the event and don't want to back out because of an unexpected cost.</p>\n<p>Buying tickets is not the only time you find yourself staring down a hidden fee. Here's what you need to know about the surprise extra charges on common purchases, and how you can either plan for them or fight them.</p>\n<h2>Events</h2>\n<p>Buying tickets to events has changed a lot in my lifetime. Back in high school, I actually had to visit a box office or local retailer to purchase tickets to an upcoming event. I even camped out to be among the first in line for a popular band that came to town. When buying them in person was the only way to get tickets, the face value of the ticket was much closer to the amount you would pay for it. In general, you'd only pay sales tax on top of the ticket price.</p>\n<p>All of that changed when Ticketmaster became the primary method for buying tickets. The event sales giant started charging everything from service fees to delivery fees to processing fees to facility charges. These additional fees are revealed only after you have chosen your seats at the base ticket price, and while you're watching a clock tick down the amount of time before the tickets are released to another hopeful concert-goer.</p>\n<p>These fees add 25% to 35% to the price of your ticket, and the use of the countdown clock and the belated reveal of the fees both work to make you grumble but ultimately fish out your credit card to pay anyway.</p>\n<p>For a short time, Ticketmaster held an absolute monopoly on tickets, and it still represents more than 80% of the market share of the ticket-sales industry. However, that doesn't mean you have no choice.</p>\n<h3>Avoiding the fees</h3>\n<p>The savvy concert-goer and sports fan has several options available for reducing ticket fees. To start, you can purchase directly from the venue to reduce your fees. Even if you buy the tickets online through the venue's online portal, you can usually get a lower price than you would through the big ticket brokers. This is what I did to buy my comedy tickets. As unhappy as I was paying an additional $32 for them, it represented only a 19% markup. Had I gone through Ticketmaster, the markup was just over 34%.</p>\n<p>If you have more time than money, rocking the old school method of buying tickets in person at the box office can save you even more money. </p>\n<h2>Airline tickets</h2>\n<p>Within the past 10 years, airlines figured out they could increase profit by reducing the freebies they used to offer. They started by levying a checked baggage fee, which ranges from $10 to $150 per bag, depending on which airline you fly and how many bags you're checking.</p>\n<p>From there, travelers started seeing seat selection fees when booking online. While there are always a few \"free\" seats that are covered by the cost of the ticket, you'll often find they're sparsely spread throughout the cabin and often not next to each other. This means that you (and your traveling companions) will each have to pay a seat selection fee if you'd like to be seated together.</p>\n<p>Additional fees may include charges to watch the onboard entertainment and for drinks and snacks. All of these fees can inflate the cost of your flight by as much as 50% or more.</p>\n<h3>Avoiding the fees</h3>\n<p>Within the airline industry, fees vary a great deal. That means it's still possible to shop around to avoid extra expenses on top of your airline ticket. Some low-cost airlines allow you to bring up to two checked bags for free, skip seat selection fees, and enjoy complimentary snacks, drinks, and entertainment onboard. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Even if you don't have many airline choices because you don't live near a major airport, you can still keep your fees lower by purchasing your tickets as far in advance as possible. The sooner you buy your tickets, the more likely it is you'll be able to pick your seats for free. </p>\n<p>In addition, making sure you understand exactly what fees your airline charges can help you to avoid last-minute surprises. Knowing before you reach the airport that you'll have to pay for a checked bag gives you the option of packing light with just a carry-on. And you can come to your flight prepared with snacks and entertainment to avoid paying for them on the plane.

Unfortunately, the rates you see online don't necessarily match the amount you pay once it's time to check out. That's because of charges like resort or amenity fees, parking fees, online booking fees, and Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>These fees vary and can be difficult to determine ahead of time. For instance, the resort fee is a daily additional charge levied for your use of the hotel's amenities, from gym and pool access, to using the hotel's private beach or enjoying the breakfast spread. Even if you have no plans to use any of the amenities covered by the resort fee, you're still on the hook for the fee. Most hotels charge a flat daily rate for their resort fee, but some charge a percentage of your room rate or a per person rate per day.</p>\n<h3>Avoiding the fees</h3>\n<p>Parking fees and Wi-Fi charges tend to be the easiest fees to determine ahead of time. Calling around and asking what these fees will be can help you decide where to stay. You may also be able to ask for discounts on these fees based on membership to groups like AAA or AARP or a hotel loyalty program.</p>\n<p>Many countries prohibit charging undisclosed fees like resort fees and online booking fees, but the United States has no specific prohibition — although deceptive pricing is against the law. This means you can find the information about resort and other fees by either looking on your preferred hotel's website or by calling and asking. However, the fees are not necessarily going to be easy to find or calculate ahead of time.</p>\n<p>There are several options for opting out of resort fees. The first is to only book rooms at hotels that do not charge them. You can check if a hotel charges resort fees at ResortFeeChecker.com.</p>\n<p>In addition, booking a room using <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel rewards points</a> often means that your resort fee and your booking fee are waived. Hotel loyalty programs can also potentially earn you fee-free stays.

Pick and choose what you need from each of the “Optional” categories depending on your trip.</p>\n<p>If you're outdoorsy and headed for Nepal, bring your down jacket, scarf, hat, hiking shoes, and headlamp. If you're city-slicking through Paris in autumn, leave that stuff behind and bring your ballet flats and a sweater for cool evenings.</p>\n<p>This list is for guys and gals. Use it as your template and customize it as needed. </p>\n<h3>Luggage and Packing</h3>\n<p>This is the most crucial part of your packing list; luggage is your home on the road, and packing tools help you stay organized and maximize space.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rolling Luggage/Backpack – I prefer rolling luggage (like the soft-sided Pacsafe Toursafe 21) because then I use a backpack as my personal item/daypack for electronics and extras.

Tieks are pricey but preferred by pro travelers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Toiletries</h3>\n<p>You can buy every toiletry below in solid form from Lush. A carry-on traveler's dream!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Face Wash</li>\n<li>Soap</li>\n<li>Moisturizer</li>\n<li>Shampoo</li>\n<li>Conditioner</li>\n<li>Hair Honey (Styling)</li>\n<li>Toothpaste</li>\n<li>Deodorant – Salt Crystal deodorant lasts forever and takes up no space (all natural)</li>\n<li>Toothbrush</li>\n<li>Razor</li>\n<li>Nail Clippers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Optional Toiletries</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hair Ties</li>\n<li>Menstrual Cup</li>\n<li>Tweezers</li>\n<li>Makeup</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Medical Kit</h3>\n<p>Hedge your bets!

Read the fine print when you book your flight and pack accordingly.</p>\n<p>A sneaky trick is to wear a jacket with many pockets and load them up with heavy stuff; anything you are wearing doesn't count toward weight limits!

Maybe you decided that this is the year you'll finally pay off high interest credit card debt, or perhaps you're using a budget for the first time in your life. Whatever your goals are, you probably know that it will take time and perseverance to get there. </p>\n<p>But how should you invest your money? If you have an extra $100 per month to spare, there's more than one way to build wealth and<em> finally</em> get ahead. </p>\n<p>We reached out to financial advisors to find out how they would invest an extra $100 per month in the new year, and here's what they said. </p>\n<h2>1. Bump up your 401(k) contributions </h2>\n<p>Colorado financial planner Mitchell Bloom of Bloom Wealth says your workplace 401(k) is a good place to start if your employer offers one, and particularly if you can qualify for an employer match. After all, an employer match you can qualify for is the closest thing to \"free money\" you'll ever receive at work, so you might as well take advantage. </p>\n<p>You can strive to boost the percentage of your 401(k) contributions in order to funnel approximately $100 more into your account each month, but you may also be able to set aside a flat $100 in funds monthly if your workplace plan allows. </p>\n<p>Either way, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-traps-to-avoid-with-your-401k?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">money in a 401(k) plan</a> can grow tax-free and compound over time, and you won't have to pay taxes on distributions until you reach retirement age. </p>\n<p>Also note that if you don't have a workplace retirement plan, all isn't lost. </p>\n<p>Instead, you may want to \"consider using a low-cost advisory firm like Betterment, where they will build a fully diversified globally allocated portfolio model with fractional shares so you can achieve diversification with a small investment amount,\" says Bloom.</p>\n<h2>2. Save $100 per month in a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Jeff Rose of Good Financial Cents says that consumers can also consider saving money in a Roth IRA if they meet requirements to contribute. While this type of account requires you to invest money that has already been taxed, your contributions can grow tax-free and compound until you reach retirement age. Once you're 59 ½ or older, you can withdraw money from a Roth IRA without paying income taxes, which is pretty sweet.</p>\n<p>In 2020, most people can contribute up to $6,000 to a Roth IRA and traditional IRA account. However, individuals ages 50 and older can contribute an additional $1,000 for the year for a total of $7,000. </p>\n<p>Income limits do apply, however. Married couples who file taxes jointly can't contribute to a Roth IRA if they earn over $206,000, and their contributions are phased out for incomes between $196,000 and $205,999. Single filers with incomes over $139,000 cannot contribute, and their contributions will be phased out for incomes between $124,000 and $138,999.

Save for emergencies</h2>\n<p>Also, consider saving for emergencies if you haven't already. Financial advisor Jake Northrup of Experience Your Wealth says that your emergency fund should include at least three months of living expenses, but potentially more.</p>\n<p>You'll likely want to keep your emergency fund in an account you can access such as a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-online-savings-accounts?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high-yield savings account</a>. While this means your emergency cash won't bring in a huge return, this money can literally save your finances if you face a surprise medical bill you can't pay or experience a job loss. </p>\n<p>Further, having a fully funded emergency fund can also help you avoid charging up credit card balances with exorbitant interest rates.

Save for future healthcare expenses in an HSA</h2>\n<p>Financial planner Taylor Schulte, who is also host of the <em>Stay Wealthy Retirement Podcast</em>, says that assuming an emergency savings fund is in place and high-interest debt is paid off, the best place to put extra cash is into a Health Savings Account (HSA). </p>\n<p>\"The HSA is the magical unicorn of tax-advantaged investment accounts,\" he says. \"Unlike any other account, they are triple tax-advantaged.\"</p>\n<p>Schulte says this because you can invest up to certain limits on a tax-advantaged basis each year, then your money grows tax-free. When you take distributions in order to pay for qualified healthcare expenses, you won't pay taxes then, either. </p>\n<p>There are some requirements in order to use an HSA, however, including the requirement that you have a high deductible health plan. For 2020, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines a high deductible health plan as any plan with a deductible of at least $1,400 for an individual or $2,800 for a family, notes <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/high-deductible-health-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healthcare.gov</a>. Also note that any high deductible health plan's total yearly out-of-pocket expenses must be less than $6,900 for an individual or $13,800 for a family. </p>\n<p>Morgan Ranstrom, who works as a financial planner in Minneapolis, MN, says you should strive to keep enough cash in your HSA to pay your insurance's annual deductible in case of unexpected health costs, but beyond that you can invest the rest for long-term growth. </p>\n<p>\"With regular contributions, potential investment growth, and minimal withdrawals, you'll have an account that may be used to fund medical expenses in retirement without tax penalty,\" he says. \"How great is that?\"</p>\n<h2>5. Pay off high interest credit card debt</h2>\n<p>While you may not consider debt repayment as an investment, the financial return can work similarly. Note that any <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-paying-off-your-debt-early?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">debt you pay off</a> is no longer charging an outrageous interest rate, and that means more money in your pocket each month that you can save or invest for the future. </p>\n<p>Debt expert Chris Peach, who teaches consumers how to pay off debt through his Awesome Money Course, says you should check to see the interest rate you're paying on your credit cards, keeping in mind that the average credit card APR is well over 17%. </p>\n<p>\"For most people, getting an 18% return on your investment every year is more like a dream come true than a reality,\" he says. Fortunately, you can achieve that return by paying off high interest debt and saving the money you would normally pay toward interest each month. </p>\n<p>Let's say you have a credit card balance of $10,000 at 18% APR and you've been making minimum payments on this card for years. Making the minimum payment of $200 each month would take you another 94 months to pay off the balance, which also results in $8,622 more in total interest paid, notes Peach. </p>\n<p>But what if you were able to invest $100 per month as an over payment on your credit card?</p>\n<p>\"Though it may not sound like a ton of money, $100 more per month will pay the balance off 47 months earlier and saves almost $4,000 in interest,\" says Peach. \"Not bad for a $100 monthly investment if you ask me.\"</p>\n<h2>6. Invest in yourself</h2>\n<p>Fee-only financial advisor Russ Thornton, who focuses on providing retirement planning for women, says an investment in yourself can also pay off in a big way. \"This could be used to buy books, audiobooks, online courses, offline courses, professional associations, personal training sessions, or something else,\" he says. </p>\n<p>If you acquire new or deeper knowledge that could help you perform your job, it could help you get a bigger raise or even a promotion, whereas learning a new skill could help you create a side hustle that could ultimately help you bring in more income. </p>\n<p>You could even get involved with a professional association or networking group to build your network, says Thornton. \"This could help with your current career or might open doors to new opportunities — both personal or professional.\"</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

All that's required to qualify is signing up for a rewards credit card and getting approved, then meeting a minimum spending requirement (usually in the $1,000 to $4,000 range) within a specific length of time (usually three months). </p>\n<p>However, there are plenty of scenarios where earning a new credit card sign-up bonus just isn't in the cards. Maybe you're planning on buying a home in the near future and want to keep new hard inquiries off your credit report, or perhaps your credit score recently took a dip and you can't get approved for the top rewards credit cards.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason you can't earn a sign-up bonus right now, there are plenty of ways to rack up rewards using the cards you already have, as well as other methods. </p>\n<h2>1. Use the right card for different types of purchases</h2>\n<p>If you have a handful of rewards credit cards with different earning structures, it's crucial to make sure you're using the optimal card for each purchase you make. </p>\n<p>Different cards might offer bonus points for certain types of purchases. One card might offer extra points on dining, while another offers bonus points for groceries. The key to maximizing rewards is ensuring you're using the card that offers the most points on everything you buy. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/3-ways-your-cash-rewards-can-make-you-rich?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3 Ways Your Credit Card Rewards Can Make You Rich</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Find more expenses you can cover with a credit card</h2>\n<p>Make sure to go over your monthly spending and bills to ensure every purchase you can make with plastic is being paid with a credit card.</p>\n<p>While it's easy to use credit for groceries, gas, and miscellaneous purchases you make, take a few minutes to think outside the box on the biggest expenses you have each month. Could you pay for daycare with a credit card? How about quarterly tax payments? Health insurance premiums? Your monthly utility bills?</p>\n<p>The more <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/should-you-pay-your-bills-with-a-credit-card?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expenses you can cover</a> with a credit card each month, the more rewards you'll rack up over time. Just make sure you're not paying a fee to pay bills with a credit card. Otherwise, the rewards you earn may not be worth it. </p>\n<h2>3. Take advantage of shopping portals and dining programs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-use-airline-shopping-portals-to-cash-in-on-rewards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airline shopping portals</a> through programs like American AAdvantage, Delta SkyMiles, and Southwest Rapid Rewards let you earn additional airline miles for each dollar you spend, and all you have to do is \"click through\" your favorite portal before you shop. You'll usually earn an extra 1-3 miles for each dollar you spend at participating stores in these portals, but it is possible to earn an additional 10 miles or more per $1 spent in obscure specialty stores, or when stores are having bonus promotions.</p>\n<p>Many airline loyalty programs also offer <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-airline-dining-rewards-programs?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dining programs</a> that let you earn additional rewards when you dine at participating restaurants in your area. Some even offer initial sign-up bonuses when you dine out at least three times within 30 days. </p>\n<h2>4. Use Amex Offers or Chase Offers</h2>\n<p>Both American Express and Chase have their own \"offers\" that let you earn additional rewards or cash back when you make a specific purchase within a predetermined length of time. You do need to log into your account and add these offers to your card before you make a purchase to qualify, and you'll have to meet all terms and conditions they stipulate as well. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Note that not all Amex Offers and Chase Offers reward you for shopping, per se. Some give you cash back when you spend a certain amount of money with a hotel chain, or when you spend a specific amount of cash on airfare with a certain airline. You might also earn rewards for buying a new mattress, hiring a dog sitter, or signing up for identity theft protection. </p>\n<p>Also, remember that both Chase Offers and Amex Offers feature a benefit <em>on top of </em>the rewards you receive. You can score a discount with an offer, but you'll also earn applicable rewards for each dollar you spend with your credit card. </p>\n<h2>5. Sign up for free loyalty programs</h2>\n<p>Finally, don't forget that most loyalty programs let you join for free, and that there are plenty of ways to rack up certain types of <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-7-best-ways-to-earn-travel-points-and-miles-without-a-credit-card?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rewards without a credit card</a>. For example, you can join airline loyalty programs and earn airline miles each time you fly, regardless of how you pay for your airfare. The same is true with hotel programs like Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors, since you earn hotel points for each dollar you spend with these brands.</p>\n<p>If you don't travel a lot, also keep in mind that some cash back programs are available for regular purchases you buy. The Rakuten portal, for example, lets you earn up to 40% off purchases made at participating stores like Amazon, Macy's.com, and Walmart.com. </p>\n<p>Like other shopping portals, cash back portals also set you up to double up on rewards. You can get cash back through a portal like Rakuten or Dosh for purchases you make, but you'll also earn rewards if you use a point-earning credit card to pay.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

He didn't eat or drink water all day, and we were worried. That night, we took him to the 24-hour emergency veterinarian and Tivo was diagnosed with a bacterial stomach bug and dehydration. We went home with antibiotics, a saline IV, and a $200 vet bill.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, we could afford this bill for unexpected emergency care for Tivo. But if he were diagnosed with a chronic condition or needed a very costly intervention, we might find ourselves facing some heartbreaking financial decisions.</p>\n<p>Pet insurance is often touted as a solution to these worries. With pet insurance covering some costs of veterinary care, you're never forced to choose between your beloved pet and your finances. However, does this kind of coverage make sense for most pet-owners?</p>\n<p>Here's what you need to know about pet insurance so you can keep your fur babies bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for years to come.</p>\n<h2>Premium costs</h2>\n<p>As with human health insurance, pet insurance charges you a monthly premium for your pet's coverage. According to Value Penguin, the average monthly cost for canine pet insurance is $47.20, and the average for feline insurance is $29.54 for accident and illness coverage.</p>\n<p>Of course, this doesn't tell the whole story of what to expect from premium costs. Many pet insurers increase premiums with the age of your pet. Which means the $47 per month you pay to keep your 4-year-old pup healthy could rise with his/her age, making the premiums harder to keep up with just as they're more likely to need age-related medical intervention. In addition, different breeds can have different premium prices, since there are some hereditary conditions that various breeds may be more prone to.</p>\n<p>However, even with these potential issues, there are some methods to keep premiums manageable. For instance, some tried and true insurance reduction strategies work just as well for your pet's health insurance as they do for your own. These include increasing your deductible, reducing the percentage that the insurance reimburses, or limiting the annual payout rather than choosing unlimited coverage.</p>\n<p>These strategies can keep your premiums affordable while still helping with big veterinary bills. But you need to be prepared to pay anything above and beyond the coverage limits you set up.

To start, unlike (some) human health insurance, most pet insurance will not cover preventive care and annual exams. So you will need to plan for these costs on top of your premiums.</p>\n<p>Pet insurance policies generally come in two varieties: accident and illness policies, and accident-only policies. In general, accident-only policies do not raise their premiums as your pet ages, making this kind of insurance more affordable long-term. However, accident-only policies tend to be cheaper because your pet is less likely to get injured than fall ill. If you decide to invest in pet insurance, getting both accident and illness protection will likely offer you more protection.</p>\n<p>That said, each insurer gets to decide which illnesses, conditions, and services it covers, and not all ailments are covered. Many insurers also do not cover the diagnostic exam for a particular illness, even if the treatments are covered. Make sure you pay attention to the details of what your potential insurer will cover before signing up for coverage.</p>\n<p>As with many types of human health insurance, most pet insurance policies exclude preexisting conditions. Unfortunately, some insurers consider health problems to be \"preexisting\" if they crop up within a year of the purchase of your policy. Insuring your pet when they're young is the best way to avert the preexisting condition coverage gap.</p>\n<p>Finally, pet insurance coverage is usually handled via reimbursement. That means you'll be on the hook to pay the vet bill at the time of service, and you'll submit your receipts to your insurer to receive reimbursement.

In fact, many consumer advocates recommend that pet owners put aside an amount equal to the annual premium into a savings account each year. This will give you the same peace of mind that you can cover any potential health care needs for your pet while also allowing you to keep the money if you never need to use it.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>However, if you struggle with financial discipline, this strategy will leave you in a difficult situation if your furry friend needs an expensive procedure. Pet insurance can provide you with the protection your pet needs even if you struggle with money. </p>\n<h2>Show your love with an emergency fund</h2>\n<p>Whether or not you decide to purchase pet insurance, remember that you'll have to pay upfront for any veterinary procedures. With insurance, you will get reimbursed for covered care, but you will still need to have access to funds to pay for Mittens' kidney stone removal or Rex's arthritis care at the time of care.</p>\n<p>This means that one of the best ways you can protect your furry friends and avoid heartbreaking financial choices is to have an emergency fund. With or without pet insurance, set some money aside for the unexpected so you can enjoy your four-legged family members for years to come.

Help marine conservation efforts in Mexico</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>With nearly 5,800 miles of coastline that includes the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, as well as the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, Mexico has a huge amount of ocean surrounding it. Those waters are home to part of the second largest barrier reef system in the world, the Great Mayan Reef, as well as numerous endangered species of sea creatures.</p>\n<p>As a result, there are lots of opportunities within Mexico to help out with marine conservation efforts. Global Vision International (GVI) offers a <a href=\"https://www.gviusa.com/programs/marine-conservation-expedition-mexico/#\" target=\"_blank\">highly rated program</a> in the Yucatan region that requires volunteers to earn their scuba diving qualifications before joining the team to help secure the future of the local coral reefs. Other projects focus on turtle and crocodile conservation, like <a href=\"https://www.projects-abroad.org/volunteer-projects/conservation-and-environment/sea-turtle-and-coastal-conservation/volunteer-mexico/\" target=\"_blank\">this one by Projects Abroad</a> based on the Pacific Coast.</p>\n<h2>2. Work at Thailand's elephant sanctuaries</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Elephants hold a special place in Thai culture and you'll find them represented everywhere from patterned prints on clothing to works of art. Despite this, it's now widely known that many of the captive elephants in Thailand are poorly treated from birth, and activities like elephant riding are cruel and unethical.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are several sanctuaries and parks where previously captive and working animals come for rehabilitation. The Wildlife Friends Foundation runs <a href=\"http://www.wildlifevolunteer.org/wildlife-volunteer-projects/elephant-sanctuary/\" target=\"_blank\">volunteer programs helping abused elephants</a> at the Elephant Refuge and Education Center near Bangkok, which provides a chain-free environment for the elephants to roam. And <a href=\"https://www.gviusa.com/programs/volunteer-elephants-thailand/?gvi_source=google&amp;gvi_medium=organic&amp;gvi_date=20171120\" target=\"_blank\">this GVI program</a> in Chiang Mai aims to assist with the rehabilitation of elephants previously used in the tourism industry.</p>\n<h2>3. Provide health tips to children in South Africa</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Though it has one of the most developed economies on the continent, South Africa also suffers from extremely high rates of poverty, and the availability of basic health care is limited in some regions. Among the various health concerns, a particularly prominent problem is the shockingly high occurrence of HIV/AIDS, with <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/southafrica\" target=\"_blank\">UNAids stating</a> that South Africa has the \"largest HIV epidemic in the world.\"</p>\n<p>Facilities provide help for the many people unable to afford private health care as well as offering information on general health topics. <a href=\"https://www.gviusa.com/programs/volunteer-healthcare-project-south-africa/?gvi_source=google&amp;gvi_medium=organic&amp;gvi_date=20171120\" target=\"_blank\">This GVI program</a> involves running workshops in local communities in and around Cape Town, mainly aimed at children, and teaching them healthy habits.

Teach English in Cambodia</h2>\n<p></p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Cambodia is still recovering from the brutal regime of the Khmer Rouge, which slaughtered millions in its state-sponsored genocide, carried out between 1975 and 1979. One of the ways they're rebuilding is through the development of its burgeoning tourism industry, and an easy way to help is by teaching English to its residents.</p>\n<p>Kids who have English as a second language under their belts will have much greater employment prospects in the future. This <a href=\"https://www.gooverseas.com/volunteer-abroad/cambodia/volunteer-in-cambodia/63864\" target=\"_blank\">Go Overseas' program</a> gives you the opportunity to undertake teachers' training while making a difference in the lives of the children you teach. <a href=\"http://www.volunteerincambodia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Volunteer in Cambodia</a> is another organization offering local placements in villages throughout Cambodia for periods of three months at a time.

Protect plants and animals in Costa Rica</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The country of Costa Rica packs a biologically diverse punch for its relatively small size. It accounts for an estimated 4 percent of the planet's species. That means it's green, lush, and has countless species of plants and animals that live and thrive within its borders. Amazingly, hundreds of these species are actually endemic to Costa Rica and not found anywhere else.</p>\n<p>And there are huge efforts being made to protect the wildlife that exists there. <a href=\"https://www.gvi.co.uk/volunteer-in-costa-rica/\" target=\"_blank\">GVI has numerous projects</a> in place including jaguar conservation, biodiversity conservation, and many more. Go Abroad offers a <a href=\"https://www.goabroad.com/providers/international-volunteer-hq/programs/volunteer-in-eco-agriculture-conservation-in-costa-rica-111168\" target=\"_blank\">more agriculture-focused program</a> in which volunteers help local farming communities with their daily farming activities, but also with reforestation efforts.</p>\n<h2>6. Support women's rights in India</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>India is a country that's developing rapidly, and according to Nasdaq, it has one of the fastest growing economies in the world. For some, its emergence as a global financial powerhouse means it's a land of endless opportunities. But for others, particularly those who live in more rural areas, the pace of change remains painfully slow.</p>\n<p>It's a particularly tough environment for India's women, with widespread discrimination, inequality, and physical violence still commonplace. Numerous programs like <a href=\"https://www.kayavolunteer.com/project/womens-empowerment-community-work-india/\" target=\"_blank\">this one from Kaya</a> have been set up to help address this and support women to bring about the necessary changes through teaching English and providing education on women's rights. GVI also provides a <a href=\"https://www.gviusa.com/programs/womens-empowerment-project-india/\" target=\"_blank\">program focused on promoting gender equality</a> through working with disadvantaged women to help them overcome the social issues they face.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Who doesn't appreciate getting suddenly richer?</p>\n<p>However, making good decisions with a large infusion of cash can feel overwhelming, especially if your windfall comes about because of something negative. For instance, when I received a life insurance payout after my father passed away in 2013, the money was both emotionally charged and stress-inducing, and I was terrified of making a misstep.</p>\n<p>If you've received a windfall, taking your time and making intentional decisions about the money will serve you better in the long run. Here's how you can do that. </p>\n<h2>Take a break before making any decisions</h2>\n<p>No matter how you received your newfound wealth, you're likely to have a number of strong emotions associated with the event. And we all know that emotions and rational decisions can struggle to coexist. That's why it's a good idea to take a little time before you make any decisions whatsoever with your new money. </p>\n<p>If the money came to you because of a negative situation, such as a death in the family, the end of a lawsuit, or the sale of a beloved business, your emotions will inevitably color your view of the money. I personally found that I wanted Dad's insurance money to no longer be in my hands, because having it was a reminder of my loss. </p>\n<p>Even if you have positive associations with the money (after a lucky weekend in Vegas or a surprise profit-sharing bonus from work), those fuzzy feelings may prompt you to make risky decisions to keep the good vibes coming. Letting some time pass between receiving your windfall and deciding what to do with it can help you view the money more dispassionately so you can make the best possible decisions with it.</p>\n<p>So how long should you pause before deciding what to do? Depending on the size of the windfall, you might want to wait as long as six months (or longer) before making any decisions. This will give you time to process your emotions so that you're psychologically ready to make these big choices.

Life insurance benefits and other inheritance money can sometimes stay safely in the same account you'll be paid from. In these cases, it's common that your money will even earn some interest while it stays put. Simply keeping the money in place can be a good way to give yourself the emotional breathing room you need without worrying about making a preliminary decision.</p>\n<p>Other types of windfalls, such as lottery winnings or an inherited retirement account, may give you the option of taking a lump sum or annual payouts. Choosing annual payouts (when available) will give you the opportunity to make lots of smaller decisions over several years, rather than overwhelming yourself with the need to make several big decisions at once. </p>\n<p>For when you have no choice but to take your entire windfall into your hot little hands, stashing it in a money market account or high-yield savings account can be a good way to keep it safe. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/interest-rates-are-rising-heres-where-to-keep-your-cash?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interest Rates Are Rising: Here's Where to Keep Your Cash</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Consult a tax professional</h2>\n<p>The tax implications of your windfall could be a major deciding factor in how you choose to use it. Some types of windfalls, like life insurance benefits, can pass to you tax-free. However, for most types of windfalls, you can assume that Uncle Sam will want his cut.</p>\n<p>For instance, the killing you made at the blackjack table is considered normal income to the IRS, which means you may have shifted into a higher tax bracket when you walked off with a cool $40,000. If you don't plan for this shift in your income taxes, you may find yourself staring down a nasty surprise come tax time. Your CPA can help you figure out the best way to navigate your sudden bump in income. For instance, they might suggest that you maximize your tax-deferred retirement contribution this year to help offset your windfall.</p>\n<p>If you sold a business, inherited taxable property or accounts, or even got a major bonus at work, a tax professional can help you determine the most tax-efficient way to access and enjoy your new wealth so that you're not stuck holding the bag when the taxman comes calling.

But reducing or eliminating your debt burden will give you more peace of mind and more financial freedom in the future. That money will turn into what feels like little windfalls every month when you don't have to send most of your paycheck towards your debt.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you haven't prioritized saving for retirement, your windfall can give you a great opportunity to improve your financial future. Maximize your <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-retirement-planning-steps-late-starters-must-make?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">401(k) or IRA contribution</a> this year (and enjoy the tax benefit), and use it as a springboard to send more money to your retirement every year thereafter.</p>\n<p>Finally, keep some of your windfall as an emergency cushion. Knowing that you'll be covered the next time a financial emergency strikes is a great gift to your future self.</p>\n<h2>Have some fun</h2>\n<p>It does feel good to receive a large amount of money, and having a little fun with it is a great way to enjoy it.</p>\n<p>No matter how a windfall comes into your life, splurging on something that you couldn't or wouldn't otherwise have can be a great way to enjoy your good fortune. Deciding to use a set amount of money however you please is a life-affirming way to mark the occasion of your windfall.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

But shopping for a car isn't always as simple as showing up on the lot. There are a lot of decisions to be made between now and walking into the dealership: make and model, new or used, preferred features, type of financing to use, and the list goes on. </p>\n<p>Before making that type of significant purchase, it's best to have a plan. Here are four steps to keep you focused and protect your financial health as you prepare to make your next vehicle purchase.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Set a budget</h2>\n<p>Before you even begin to browse cars, it's vital to set a budget. One of the best ways to do this is to create a list that differentiates between your <em>wants</em> and <em>needs</em> in a car. If you're a commuter, you likely need fuel-efficiency, and while you may want the latest technology, like Bluetooth, it's not a necessity. Outlining your \"must haves\" can give you more control as you begin looking at costs, as you already know which items you're willing to forgo if it saves money. </p>\n<p>As you look at different models, stick to cars your budget can handle, even if there was a sudden change in your financial situation, such as a job loss. The average new vehicle loan amount was $32,480 in the third quarter of 2019, according to Experian, while the average new car payment was $550. These amounts can give you a baseline as you look at your own budget to identify the total amount you feel comfortable borrowing, as well as how much of a monthly payment you can handle. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-easy-ways-to-calculate-your-new-car-budget?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Easy Ways to Calculate Your New Car Budget</a>)</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Ensure your credit is in good shape </h2>\n<p>About three to six months before you start seriously shopping for cars, make sure your credit is in good shape. Continue to pay your bills on time, and request a free credit report through Experian or by visiting annualcreditreport.com to check for fraudulent activity and to ensure all information is accurate. </p>\n<p>Additionally, use the tools available to improve your credit, like <a href=\"http://www.experian.com/boost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Experian Boost</a> before you hit the car lots. Experian Boost can increase your credit score instantly, and it gives lenders a more complete picture of your financial history, and your ability to pay off debt by looking at your on-time utility and telecom payments.

But financing isn't limited to a single type of lender. In addition to loan options offered at a dealership, it's a good idea to shop around for loans to see who has the best terms and rates available. Just because you put in an inquiry at one bank doesn't mean you can't look at another, but also consider looking at credit unions and traditional finance companies to find the best deal for your situation. </p>\n<p>This is one area where <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/is-it-worth-paying-for-your-credit-score?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your credit score</a> can make a significant difference in what rates you're offered — the average interest rate for new vehicles for consumers who are in the \"prime\" credit tier is 4.21 percent, whereas for consumers in the \"subprime\" credit tier, it is 14.06 percent. </p>\n<p>You can shop for a car loan without worrying about your credit score. Inquiries for auto loans are either counted as only one inquiry when they occur within a 30-day period, or may be excluded entirely from the calculation. </p>\n<h2>Step 4: If shopping for a used vehicle, get a vehicle history report</h2>\n<p>It's not surprising that buying a used car can be a significant cost savings. In fact, at $20,446, the average used vehicle loan last quarter was about $12,000 less than financing a new vehicle. When financing, that can mean significant savings in the amount of interest you'll pay over the term of your loan. </p>\n<p>However, it's important to go into a used car purchase fully informed, so be sure to request a vehicle history report, like an AutoCheck report, before committing to the purchase. These reports include how many previous owners the vehicle had, or if there were any reported accidents. This can help you avoid surprises and give you a better idea of the value of the car.

Unfortunately, time keeps on ticking away, making it easy to spend years dreaming of financial security without making progress toward your goals.</p>\n<p>Now that 2020 has arrived, it may be the perfect time to stop making excuses and start making moves. After all, it's more than a new year — we're in a brand-new decade.</p>\n<p>But which moves have the potential for the most impact? We interviewed several financial advisors to find out which steps they think nearly everyone could benefit from in 2020 and beyond, and here's what they said. </p>\n<h2>1. Increase your contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts</h2>\n<p>According to financial advisor Benjamin Brandt, who is the host of retirement podcast <em>Retirement Starts Today</em>, the beginning of the year is an excellent time to reevaluate how much you're putting away for retirement. Fortunately, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) increased the maximum you can contribute to a 401(k) account in 2020, bringing up your total maximum contribution amount to $19,500. </p>\n<p>\"Could you save a little more for the future version of yourself?\" he asks. \"Calculate what a 1% increase in your savings rate might be, and commit to that increase.\"</p>\n<p>You might not even notice the money missing from your budget when savings is increased in such small increments, but you'll never know unless you try.

Take stock of changes in your life that took place over the last year</h2>\n<p>Financial planner Luis F. Rosa, who is also the host of the <em>On My Way to Wealth</em> podcast, says that pretty much everyone should sit down and analyze any big life changes they've endured over the last year or two, including marriage, divorce, or the birth of a new child. </p>\n<p>You should also review your beneficiary designations on your 401K, life insurance, and other accounts to make sure they are up to date as per your wishes, he says. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-money-moves-every-single-parent-should-make?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Money Moves Every Single Parent Should Make</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Learn to live within your means</h2>\n<p>Most people manage their money in the most backwards way possible, meaning they buy what they want and try to save anything that's left. Financial advisor Christopher Clepp of Strategic Financial Group says people need to \"reverse their thinking\" if they hope to reverse this trend in their lives.</p>\n<p>Instead of buying what you want and worrying about savings as an afterthought, Clepp says to \"invest for the lifestyle you want and spend what is left over.\" </p>\n<p>You don't need to keep track of every expenditure if you're saving enough to begin with, he says. \"If you need to save 20% per month, then save that first and the other 80% spend as you see fit as long as you don't exceed that number or run up credit card debt.\"</p>\n<h2>4. Pay off credit card debt</h2>\n<p>Credit card debt may not be overly problematic for many people in the short-term, but this type of debt doesn't really help anyone in life. Credit cards carry an average APR of over 17%, after all, so they're a poor option when you need to borrow money. And since you can use them to keep spending, they can easily be used as a crutch to build a lifestyle you can't really afford.</p>\n<p>Clepp says everyone should make 2020 the year they <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/fastest-way-to-pay-off-10000-in-credit-card-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pay off credit card debt</a> once and for all. He points out that, if you carry an average of $5,000 in credit card debt with an average APR from ages 35 to 65, that debt will cost you close to $20,000 in interest payments. That's a ridiculous amount of money, and I'm sure you can think of plenty of ways you'd want to spend that much cash. </p>\n<h2>5. Assess your insurance needs</h2>\n<p>Clepp also says that people need to look over their insurance needs every year, even if they think they're up to date. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>\"All the careful future planning can be undone by an unexpected accident,\" he says. First and foremost, you should review your home insurance, auto insurance, and any umbrella insurance coverage you have each year. </p>\n<p>Find someone who will educate you about the policies. \"Cheaper isn't always better, but you may be able to find comparable coverage for a better price,\" he says. </p>\n<p>Also, make sure to review <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/should-you-get-life-insurance-for-your-kids?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your life insurance needs</a> if you're married or have dependents. From there, review your disability insurance to make sure you're adequately protected. </p>\n<h2>6. Start using a budget</h2>\n<p>Financial planner Brandon Renfro, Ph.D. says everyone should give budgeting their income a try, and everyone should take the time to review their budget in the new year — even if it's working well so far. </p>\n<p>\"You may find that there are smaller budget items you can eliminate,\" he says. \"The key here is a lot of times the smaller items go unnoticed, precisely because they are small.\"</p>\n<p>By going over your budget and spending for the year, you may find you're splurging in areas that don't matter to you, which could easily be reduced for more savings. You may also find you're not really using things you're paying for, such as subscription services. In that case, you could cancel unused services and funnel that money elsewhere in your budget, such as savings or debt repayment. </p>\n<p>Renfro says that, on top of reviewing your budget, you should also review any progress you're making toward your financial goals. </p>\n<p>\"This goes a little farther than simply confirming that you took the specific actions you had planned to,\" he says. \"Here, you are confirming that the actions you took actually got you closer to accomplishing what you hoped to accomplish.\"</p>\n<p>For example, maybe you planned to pay an extra $100 each month on your car loan or credit card. If you did, see how much closer you are to getting it paid off. If you achieved your goal, that's great, and you may just want to stay the course. If not, you should be asking yourself why not and taking steps to get back on track.

Improve your credit score</h2>\n<p>Financial planner R.J. Weiss of The Ways to Wealth says another area of people's lives they should focus on is their credit score, although few people keep an eye on this component of their financial health. </p>\n<p>\"This goal often gets prioritized when a large purchase is up ahead, such as a home,\" he says. \"Yet, it's something that you should monitor and improve as there are many benefits to having a great score.\"</p>\n<p>Specifically, he suggests consumers work on decreasing their total credit utilization. This is the amount of revolving credit you use compared to the amount of available credit you have.

It's the sense of freedom, the promise of fun times, and the relative ease that has made road-tripping one of the great American traditions. Every year when the snow melts away, families, groups of friends, and solo wanderers take to the highways for a big adventure.</p>\n<p>Having the right gadgets with you can take your road trip to another level, whether they're for practical use, entertainment purposes, or things to keep you safe on your journey. But sometimes it's difficult to know what to pack, and what's just going to add extra weight to your vehicle. Here are eight travel gadgets you should take on your next road trip.</p>\n<h2>1. Smartphone mount</h2>\n<p>If you're going to be using your smartphone as a GPS navigation system or music player in your car, you need to do it safely, and installing a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AMgck7\" target=\"_blank\">smartphone mount</a> is the way to go. There are several that are suitable for any model of car, whether it uses a suction cup for the windshield or a clip for the air vent. Just make sure it's in a place that's easy to see, but doesn't obstruct your view of the road.</p>\n<h2>2. Coffee handpresso</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Kx2otk\" target=\"_blank\">coffee handpresso</a> is like carrying your own personal coffee machine no matter where you go, but is so small and portable that it will fit in any handbag or daypack. The handpresso allows you to create a cup of joe in minutes with minimal effort. Like a regular machine, it forces the hot water through the coffee beans to produce a delicious shot of espresso. All you need is your favorite ground coffee beans or capsules, a flask of hot water, and a bit of hand pressure, and you've got a cafe quality cup of coffee on the go.

Solar power bank</h2>\n<p>If you're on a multiday road trip where you're doing any activities away from the car like hiking, or camping, then it pays to have a portable power source. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2vm3Rhv\" target=\"_blank\">Solar power banks</a> allow you to charge all of your small devices like phones, tablets, and cameras with the power of the sun. There's no need to worry about running out of power with one of these on hand. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-solar-power-banks?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The 5 Best Solar Power Banks</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Electric cooler</h2>\n<p>Quick and easy snacks are one of the most important elements of an epic road trip, but there's nothing worse than opening up the package of food that you've worked so hard to prepare only to find that it's gone bad. An <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KvT0X1\" target=\"_blank\">electric cooler</a> is the perfect solution, and there are plenty of varieties to choose from that simply plug into your car's electricity supply. They're also handy for chilling drinks to keep you cool on those long summer drives.

Bluetooth speaker</h2>\n<p>When you're on a road trip, you're probably going to want some entertainment, both for the actual traveling and for when you've parked at each stop along the way. A <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KtimEU\" target=\"_blank\">Bluetooth speaker</a> will allow you to sit around the campfire or in the hotel room listening to your favorite playlists and podcasts.</p>\n<p>They can also be used in the car if it's not Bluetooth enabled, and will save you from flipping through radio stations trying to find something you like. Just connect it to your phone or tablet, and you've got your preferred audio at your fingertips. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-waterproof-bluetooth-speakers?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The 5 Best Waterproof Bluetooth Speakers</a>)</p>\n<h2>6. Car USB charger</h2>\n<p>If you're driving a car that lacks built-in USB ports, then a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M5YGfb\" target=\"_blank\">USB charger</a> that fits into the cigarette lighter is the ideal fix. You can use it to charge all of your devices while you're on the go; particularly your smartphone, which will quickly run out of juice if you're using satellite navigation.</p>\n<h2>7. Multitool</h2>\n<p>Whether it's a bottle or can opener, a screwdriver, or a knife, there's always an occasion on a road trip where you'll find yourself in need of a particular tool. With a decent <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OcD26j\" target=\"_blank\">multitool</a> in your pocket, you can solve virtually any problem you come across. They come in all shapes and sizes, with hundreds of different attachments to choose from, but even the smaller keychain variety will no doubt get you out of a bind at some point.

Dashboard camera</h2>\n<p>Give yourself some peace of mind in the event of being involved in an accident when you're on a road trip with a second set of eyes. Though it's not something you ever want to happen, it pays to be prepared, and a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LZ6RdM\" target=\"_blank\">dashboard camera</a> can help prove the exact circumstances of a crash.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, people are also using them to capture the scenery around them while driving that they wouldn't otherwise be able to document. Choose one with a higher memory capacity and you could make an incredible time lapse film of your entire journey once you get home.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Still, Americans seem more than willing to pile it on no matter what. A <a href=\"https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/holiday-debt-poll/#methodology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2019 study conducted by CreditCards.com and YouGov Plc</a> showed that more than half of consumers with credit card debt said the holidays are a good reason to borrow money. Even 26% of consumers with no debt at all said they might be willing to rack up debt over the 2019 holiday season. </p>\n<p>Once those bills start pouring in and the monthly payments start siphoning your paycheck, you could easily regret it. By that point, however, it's too late.</p>\n<p>If you're in debt from the holidays and want to pay it off, you should consider consolidating and creating a plan to get out of debt once and for all. Here's how to do it:</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Assess the damage and add up your debts</h2>\n<p>The first step to get out of holiday debt may be the hardest since you have to see your spending in black and white. Take the time to add up all your credit card balances and other debts from the holidays to see how much you owe. </p>\n<p>Crafting a plan for debt repayment will be a lot easier if you write down each of your debts along with the interest rate and the current balance all in one place. Here's a good example of how your list might look:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Step 2: Choose a debt consolidation method</h2>\n<p>Once you know exactly how much debt you owe, you need to figure out the optimal way to consolidate your balances and pay them off. While there are a few other options to consider, the most popular products for debt consolidation include 0% APR credit cards and personal loans.</p>\n<h3>Balance transfer credit cards</h3>\n<p>Balance transfer credit cards let you secure 0% APR on balances transferred from other cards for anywhere from nine to 21 months. Some charge a balance transfer fee that is usually equal to 3% or 5% of your balance upfront, but the interest savings can be worth paying the fee if you get serious about your debt and knock it out quickly at 0% APR. </p>\n<p>Because <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">balance transfer credit cards</a> only let you save on interest for a short amount of time, this option works best for someone who can pay off their holiday debt on an expedited timeline. That's because once your introductory APR period is over, the interest rate on your credit card will reset to a much higher variable rate. </p>\n<h3>Personal loans</h3>\n<p>Personal loans let you consolidate debt with a low fixed interest rate, a fixed monthly payment, and a fixed repayment period. This means you'll pay interest on your consolidated debt while you pay it off, but personal loans have low rates for consumers with good credit — even as low as 4.99% APR. That's much lower than you'll pay with a credit card since the average credit card APR is currently over 17%. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/why-you-should-use-a-personal-loan-to-pay-down-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal loans</a> typically offer terms ranging from 12 months to 60 months, so they can be a better option for consumers who have a lot of debt and need plenty of time to pay it off. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-fastest-ways-to-recover-from-holiday-overspending?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Fastest Ways to Recover From Holiday Overspending</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Step 3: Pick the best repayment plan</h2>\n<p>The right debt consolidation method for you depends on a few factors — how much debt you have, how much you can afford to pay each month, and how long your debt will take to pay off. A good debt repayment calculator can help you determine your next best steps and which debt consolidation to go with, but you can also do some basic math to figure it out on your own. </p>\n<p>If you had $2,394 in debt to consolidate, here's how your strategy might look with a balance transfer credit card:</p>\n<p>For example, let's say you signed up for a card that gives you 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months, followed by a variable APR of 14.49% to 25.49%. This card doesn't charge any balance transfer fees for balances transferred in the first 60 days, so you could make a fee-free transfer of your debts right away upon approval.</p>\n<p>With 15 months to repay your holiday debt at 0% APR, you would need to pay $159.60 per month to become debt-free without interest within that time frame.</p>\n<p>If you couldn't pay that much each month toward your debts, you might want to go with a personal loan that offers a low fixed rate for several years. If you took out a personal loan that charged just 4.99% APR and let you pay off your debt over 36 months, you would only need to pay $72 per month to become debt-free over the course of three years. During that time, you would wind up paying $189 in interest on your loan. </p>\n<h2>Step 4: Stay the course</h2>\n<p>Whatever debt consolidation option you wind up with, make sure you decide on a concrete plan and stick with it. If you don't, you won't pay off as much debt as you want and you'll prolong the financial problems debt brings into your life.</p>\n<p>If you're worried about paying as much as you can toward your debts, it can also help to cut your spending for a while. Eat more of your meals at home, enact a temporary spending freeze, and stay in on the weekends for a few months instead of going out. With enough small cuts in your spending, you may be able to free up some extra cash to pay toward debt or <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-easy-ways-to-build-an-emergency-fund-from-0?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">start building a savings buffer</a>. </p>\n<p>Also make sure that, while you're in debt repayment mode, you're not using credit or loans to rack up more debt. You'll never pay off holiday debt if you keep digging throughout the year, so stop using plastic and switch to cash or debit instead.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

You receive your W2 forms in the mail in late January, and then it's time to excavate your receipt shoe box and spend a stressful weekend trying to make sense of your tax return. All in all, it feels like a hurried, overwhelming, and nerve-wracking chore that you dread every year.</p>\n<p>But what if filing your taxes didn't have to be quite so stressful?</p>\n<p>The trick to making your tax season a breeze is preparing for it early. As in, right now. If you want an easy and relaxed tax season, here's what you can do now to get ready.</p>\n<h2>Make a list of the information you'll need</h2>\n<p>One of the most frustrating moments in tax preparation is discovering you're still missing one vital piece of information after you've gathered everything you thought you needed. And it's even worse if you don't know how to find the missing information. </p>\n<p>So look over the specific info you need to file now, to give yourself time to gather all the items well before Tax Day. Specifically, you'll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A copy of last year's tax return<br>\n     </li>\n<li>The Social Security or Tax ID number of every member of your household<br>\n     </li>\n<li>The income records of every member of your household<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Receipts for your deductible expenses<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Records of any taxes you've paid throughout the year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Putting together your list of necessary information and checking each item off as you gather it will ensure that you're fully prepared when you finally sit down to file.

Many people throw all of their receipts for work-related expenses, charitable donations, mortgage payments, medical expenses, and interest statements in a single folder or box to deal with \"later.\" </p>\n<p>Now is an excellent time to dig out your receipts and start organizing them according to category. Having your receipts neatly separated now will make it easy to sort the last few that come in as the year comes to a close, and can help you get into the habit of putting them in order as you receive them.</p>\n<h2>Gather your paystubs together</h2>\n<p>Though the majority of filers will receive either a W2 or 1099 form from their employer(s), it's still a good idea to gather your paystubs before the end of the year to get a rough idea of your income. That will help you identify any potential mistakes on your W2 or 1099 forms as soon as they arrive. It's far better to catch a mistake early rather than find you need to request a corrected form close to the IRS deadline.</p>\n<p>Plus, checking over your paystubs all at once gives you a chance to take a look at your federal and state tax withholding over the year, as well as any pretax contributions you've made to your 401(k) or IRA. </p>\n<h2>Review your W4</h2>\n<p>Another great reason to look at your paystubs now is that it gives you a chance to review your W4 with your employer. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>The W4 form determines how much tax withholding is taken from each paycheck. If you expect to receive a large refund this year, you can adjust your withholding allowances now to ensure that more of your paycheck will come home with you in 2020. If, on the other hand, you worry that you may owe money because you didn't have enough withheld, now is a good time to adjust your W4 to be sure you don't have the same problem in the coming year.

And every dollar you put into these kinds of accounts reduces the amount of income you have to pay taxes on. </p>\n<p>Now is an excellent time to try to maximize your 2019 contribution. You have until the end of the calendar year to maximize your 2019 401(k) contribution, but you can continue contributing to your 2019 IRA until April 15, 2020. </p>\n<p>Getting into the habit of increasing your contribution now can also help you reach the maximum in 2020, which is going up to $19,500 for 401(k) accounts, although the IRA maximum will hold steady at $6,000.

We tend to think of a tax refund as \"free money,\" even though it's just your own salary being returned to you. But with a free money mindset, it's very easy to go overboard spending the refund on fun stuff, like a vacation or a new gadget.</p>\n<p>There's nothing wrong with enjoying your tax refund, but taking a hard look at your budget and finances now can help you to determine if having fun with your refund is the best use of the money. Is there some <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/fastest-way-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">debt you could pay down</a> (or pay off) with the refund instead? Or is there a major goal you're saving toward — like a down payment on a house — that would benefit from an injection of cash? </p>\n<p>Thinking through the best use of your tax refund before you have it in your hot little hands makes it more likely you'll make good decisions with it. Once you have the money in your possession, it's very tempting to make it rain instead of saving for a rainy day.</p>\n<h2>Make your tax season less stressful</h2>\n<p>Getting a jump start on your filing chores will not only make tax season much easier, but it can also help you prepare for your finances in the coming year. Start 2020 on the right financial foot by starting your tax season preparation early.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Unlike my husband, who does weeks (or months) of research, seeking out expert opinions, investigating the pros and cons of various options, and weighing his preferences compared to costs, I tend to figure out the minimum I need to be happy and buy the first item I come across that fits my needs and price range.</p>\n<p>According to Barry Schwartz, author of the book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2raFp3G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Paradox of Choice</a>, my method of decision-making is called \"satisficing,\" while my husband engages in \"maximizing.\" Maximizers believe that there's an ideal version of whatever they're looking for, and make it their mission to find it. But maximizers will sometimes agonize about their purchase even after they've made it, because they're afraid there is a better version out there. Satisficers, on the other hand, focus on what will be good enough to meet their minimum criteria, which means satisficers are generally happier with their decisions.</p>\n<p>While I've long felt a little smug about the fact that science has proven my way is better, I recently realized that there are some problems with making good enough decisions that maximizers don't. Here's why satisficing can sometimes lead you astray in decision-making. </p>\n<h2>Satisficing can be expensive</h2>\n<p>I recently purchased a new desk chair for myself. I work from home, and wanted to have a chair that offered more lumbar support and some padding. So I went to an office supply store and picked out an office chair that felt comfortable, looked cute, and was within my price range.</p>\n<p>I was happy with my purchase for about six weeks, until the day I put just a little weight on the back of the chair, and it broke. Turned out that the chair's back was made of particle board under the padding, and it was only a matter of time before some kind of pressure broke the board around the screws that held it in place. My \"good enough\" chair was only usable for six weeks, and now I have to buy a new one. It would have been less expensive if I had spent more time researching which chairs are highly rated, even if I had ended up with a pricier chair.</p>\n<p>And this is not the first time my willingness to settle for \"good enough\" has cost me money. From furniture to cookware, I've found that buying something that fits my minimum criteria sometimes results in a purchase that doesn't work for the long-term. Which means I have to spend more money to buy a replacement.</p>\n<p>Maximizers, on the other hand, may not be able to make a quick decision, but their commitment to researching their purchases means they're unlikely to be stuck with a busted desk chair only six weeks in.

One of them is blank notebooks and journals. I love buying these, and I want the journal I purchase to precisely fit the project I have in mind.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>For instance, I recently spent nearly an hour and a half looking through the blank notebooks on display at our local indie bookstore to find the perfect one for an upcoming creative project. While I could certainly use any blank book to scribble notes and draw pictures, the one I found embodied the exact aesthetic I was looking for and had gorgeous, creamy, unlined paper inside — just like I wanted.</p>\n<p>Finding the exact thing you want to buy after doing diligent research offers a much higher level of personal satisfaction than settling for good enough ever will. While I'm always glad to be able to make a purchase and move on with my day, I admit that my satisficing ways can sometimes cheat me out of the satisfaction of finding exactly what I want.</p>\n<h2>Satisficing can prompt careless decisions</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, satisficers like me prefer not to waste time on making a choice. We often go for the good enough option because we'd rather get the decision made and over with than spend any extra time on it.</p>\n<p>This preference for getting it done (as opposed to the maximizer preference for doing it right) can sometimes put unnecessary time pressure on the satisficer. Even though there's no particular urgency for a decision, a satisficer may feel as though they need to just make any decision so they can cross it off their list.</p>\n<p>This has happened to me on multiple occasions when I just wanted to move onto the next thing. For instance, when I needed to change a flight because of a family emergency, I chose the first flight the airline offered to me, so I could take care of the next thing that would help my family. But that flight was at an inconvenient time and would cause more stress to my family. My desire to make a decision and move on quickly meant I had to call the airline back and ask again if they would change my flight. </p>\n<p>I made that mistake because my satisficing tendencies prioritized getting things done quickly, rather than getting them done right.

Making sure that I raise my standards, embrace the enjoyment of finding the right choice for me, and slow myself down when making decisions will all help me to enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

That's because holiday loans are really just personal loans marketed specifically for holiday shoppers. The reality is, these loans come with APRs ranging from 5.99% to 35% APR, and monthly payments that can last for years. </p>\n<p>Not having the cash you need for holiday gifts is a downer for sure, but paying a high APR on holiday debt for years to come sounds a whole lot worse. For that reason, you should probably steer clear of holiday loans if you can figure out a way to avoid them. Here are some alternatives you can consider. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/here-are-the-right-ways-and-the-wrong-ways-to-use-a-personal-loan?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here Are the Right Ways (And the Wrong Ways) to Use a Personal Loan</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. See if you can trim your holiday budget</h2>\n<p>Taking the time to figure out who you really need to buy for can solve a lot of problems if you're short on cash this year. It's possible you could cut out gifts for co-workers or distant friends, and it may be time to drop any gift exchanges you typically participate in.</p>\n<p>Also, figure out if you can spend a little less on everyone who does make your list. If you can lower per-person spending to $20 from $30 for 10 people, for example, you'd see a savings of $100 right away.</p>\n<p>The holiday season isn't about gifts anyway — it's about faith and family. Your family and friends may not notice if you spend a little less this year, and they probably wouldn't take it personally if they did.

Sell your unwanted items</h2>\n<p>If you really need more money to spend this holiday season, taking stock of items you own and no longer want could help you bridge the gap. Find some stuff you can sell and you could be well on your way to covering everyone on your shopping list.</p>\n<p>The internet makes it easy to market and sell stuff you no longer want — items like clothing, exercise gear, electronics, and home decor. Try <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-i-make-800-on-month-on-ebay-selling-used-clothes?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">selling items on eBay</a>, Facebook marketplace groups, or even Craigslist. If you have extremely nice clothing and accessories to sell, you can also try ThredUp and Poshmark — both of which make it easy to sell used clothing, shoes, and more to buyers nationwide. </p>\n<h2>3. Hustle on the side</h2>\n<p>While finding part-time or temporary work isn't possible for everyone, finding a way to hustle on the side for a few weeks can help you <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/16-festive-ways-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get more cash for the holidays</a>. If you're able to pick up more hours or shifts at work, that's a good place to start. If not, you'll want to look for easy ways to earn money on the side.</p>\n<p>Consider walking dogs or pet-sitting with Rover.com, completing simple tasks with TaskRabbit, or even driving for Uber or Lyft. You could shop for groceries with Instacart or Shipt, or you could take online surveys from home to earn gift cards, Paypal cash, and more.

Cash in any rewards you have</h2>\n<p>If you have any rewards built up on a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-cash-back-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cash back credit card</a> or rewards credit card, now may be the perfect time to cash them in. Many cash back cards let you redeem points for merchandise through a portal, creating the perfect way to shop for free. You can also cash in rewards from many cards for gift cards you could give as gifts or for holiday shopping.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Keep in mind that you should try not to use rewards or cash back cards for holiday gifts unless you have the cash to pay your balance in full. Where personal loan rates start around 5.99% APR, the average credit card interest rate is well over 17%. That makes carrying a balance on your credit card an expensive burden and one you should avoid. </p>\n<h2>5. Consider a 0% APR credit card instead</h2>\n<p>There's one exception where it might make sense to use a credit card for holiday shopping instead of a personal loan or other options on this list. Some balance transfer credit cards, also called <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">0% APR credit cards</a>, let you access a line of credit without interest for a limited time. For this strategy to work, however, you would need to find a 0% APR card that lets you avoid interest on purchases and not just balance transfers.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of risks that come with this strategy, and it all starts with the fact that these offers only last for a limited time. Most 0% APR credit cards let you avoid interest for up to 15 months, although a few have longer offers. Either way, your interest rate will reset to the card's regular rate after the introductory offer ends, and those rates tend to be high.</p>\n<p>The best cards that offer 0% APR on purchases come with the longest introductory offer possible and no annual fee. Some even offer rewards and a sign-up bonus you can earn within the first few months. </p>\n<p>Just remember that you'll wind up paying off debt at a high interest rate if you don't pay your balance in full before your offer ends. To avoid long-term debt, only charge holiday purchases you know you can pay off before your card's offer ends.</p>\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n<p>The holidays are supposed to be about family and friends, but the holiday shopping season can make feeling hopeful and happy an impossible feat. And when you're short on cash, it's easy to feel guilt over not being able to afford many gifts.</p>\n<p>Ideally you'll be able to find some middle ground that lets you be generous to those you love without going into debt. Spending less this year can go a long way toward making the holidays more bearable, but hopefully you can find a way to earn more, too. If you can do both, it's possible you'll get through the holiday season without ruining your finances.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Grim-faced economists think our current historic economic expansion is headed for a fall, and the news of a looming recession couldn't feel scarier.</p>\n<p>There's good news and bad news about these opinions. The good news is that no one has a crystal ball, which means even the savviest of economic forecasters can't possibly know what our economy will do in the future. However, we do know that certain financial trends cannot go on indefinitely. (Remember in 2007 when we all thought housing prices could only ever go up? We learned the hard way in 2008 that nothing keeps growing forever.)</p>\n<p>So how can you prepare for a recession that may or may not happen in a time frame you can't predict? Thankfully, there are a number of actions you can take today to protect yourself, and your finances.</p>\n<h2>Bolster your emergency fund</h2>\n<p>Financial experts recommend that everyone build an emergency fund that could cover three to six months' worth of expenses. Your emergency fund can get you through a period of unemployment until you land your next job.</p>\n<p>However, losing your job during a recession could be a little more dire than losing it at any other time. When the economy as a whole has taken a hit, it can be much more difficult to find another employer who is hiring. This is why the median unemployment length during the recession was <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2018/article/great-recession-great-recovery.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 25 weeks</a> (nearly six months), whereas the current median length of unemployment is <a href=\"https://www.deptofnumbers.com/unemployment/duration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">just over 9 weeks</a>.</p>\n<p>Now is an excellent time to add to your emergency fund. Start an automatic transfer to your savings account with every paycheck, and look for other ways to beef up that fund.</p>\n<p>If you don't have an emergency fund that could handle a lengthy unemployment, there's no need to panic. Remember: anything you can put away will be helpful if you do find yourself with a pink slip. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-easy-ways-to-build-an-emergency-fund-from-0?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Easy Ways to Build an Emergency Fund From $0</a>)</p>\n<h2>Create your Plan B budget</h2>\n<p>Another proactive step to take is to map out what would change about your spending habits if you were to lose your job or take a pay cut. Going through your current budget and identifying the items you could cut can help reassure you that your emergency fund will weather a loss of income.</p>\n<p>You could even challenge yourself to make some small cuts now and see if you miss your former expenditures. That can free up some extra money (more for the emergency fund!) and help you feel more in control of your spending now and in the future.</p>\n<h2>Attack your credit card debt</h2>\n<p>If you're carrying a balance on your credit cards, now is a good time to get aggressive with your payoff plan. Carrying debt into a recession could make for an overwhelming burden if you experience a pay cut or a layoff. You'd hate to find yourself unable to pay your credit card bills — and have to deal with debt collectors — when you're already feeling financially stressed.

According to a recent Bank of America Workplace Benefits Report, <a href=\"https://benefitplans.baml.com/publish/content/application/pdf/GWMOL/2019WorkplaceBenefitsReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">53 percent of American employees</a> have skipped a medical appointment, a test or procedure, or purchasing medication in order to save money.</p>\n<p>This is why it's a good idea to schedule a checkup with your doctor now. Health care is expensive even when you have insurance, but it's even more expensive if you're uninsured. Getting a checkup while you have employer-sponsored coverage in place may head off any potential health (and financial) problems.</p>\n<h2>Resist the urge to tinker with your investments</h2>\n<p>Watching your retirement portfolio take a dive during a recession can be heartburn-inducing. It's easy to listen to that voice inside that's screaming at you to take your money out of the market or lose it all. But liquidating your investment accounts means you've turned your temporary, on-paper losses into permanent losses.</p>\n<p>If we do go into a recession, plan on only looking at your portfolio quarterly — or even less often. This is one situation where putting your head in the sand will help your sanity and your bottom line.</p>\n<h2>If you're close to retirement, make sure you have cash</h2>\n<p>The only caveat to leaving your investments alone is if you're on the verge of retirement. Retiring during a recession can take a serious bite out of your retirement portfolio if you're still entirely invested for the long term. In that situation, you may find yourself retiring, but unable to access your retirement income because it has taken a recessionary hit. </p>\n<p>If, in the next few years, you'll need to live off the money that's currently invested, then make sure you transfer some of your investments into cash equivalents. These will remain stable and available for you even if a recession hits just as you're ending your career.

Whether we're on the brink of a recession or the reports of the economic demise have been greatly exaggerated, you'll be glad you took these steps to protect your money.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

A 2018 report from Magnify Money showed that consumers polled added an <a href=\"https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/2018-holiday-debt-survey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">average of $1,230 in holiday credit card debt</a> during that season. Not only did 64% of respondents agree their new holiday debt took them by surprise, but almost half of respondents (49%) said it would take them five months or longer to pay off remaining holiday bills. </p>\n<p>If you're struggling with debt already, the last thing you need this year is a new pile of debt to contend with. Unfortunately, the constant pressure the holidays bring can leave you feeling like you're set up to fail from the start. Here are the best steps you can take <em>now</em> to avoid a holiday debt hangover.</p>\n<h2>1. Create a holiday shopping budget</h2>\n<p>First, you have to have an idea of how much you plan to spend on holiday gifts before you can decide how the funds will be used. </p>\n<p>If you started a holiday savings account earlier this year, you may have no trouble logging in to see how much money you have set aside. If not, you'll need to take a close look at your checking and savings accounts to see how much \"extra\" money you'll have to spend this year.</p>\n<p>As you assess your finances and excess cash, make sure to think through all your regular bills and expenses that need to be paid each month. Also, jot down any work-related year-end expenses you'll need to cover, such as <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-spend-less-on-last-minute-holiday-travel?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">holiday travel</a> or holiday parties. </p>\n<p>Then consider how many additional paydays you have until the holidays, as well as how those funds will need to be allocated. </p>\n<h2>2. Figure out how to earn extra money</h2>\n<p>If you find you don't have as much extra cash for the holidays as you hoped, you may want to get creative when it comes to finding more cash. This could mean picking up a few extra shifts at work, but it can also mean picking up some work on the side for a few weeks as the holidays approach.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for easy ways to make money before the holidays this year, look for side hustles you can start without a big investment of time or cash. Try walking dogs, babysitting neighborhood kids, or selling stuff you own and don't use anymore, for example.

Make a holiday shopping list</h2>\n<p>Once you know how much money you'll have to spend this year — or at least have a general idea, you need to make a list of people to shop for. While kids and family members will obviously make this year's list, don't forget to add in gifts for an employer or your coworkers as well as any holiday gift exchanges you participate in.</p>\n<p>Write down this list on paper, or paste it in a spreadsheet along with the amount of cash you have to spend this year. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/take-control-of-your-money-with-these-10-free-spreadsheet-templates?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Take Control of Your Money With These 10 Free Spreadsheet Templates</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Make some essential cuts</h2>\n<p>Next, take a close look at your holiday shopping list to see who needs to be cut. You may find you have family members or friends you don't need to buy a gift for because you never see them. Or perhaps you have older kids in the family who no longer receive gifts from Santa.</p>\n<p>If you participate in holiday gift exchanges and are tired of doing so, those are usually the easiest to cut out. Call the person who normally organizes the exchange each year and let them know you're on a tight budget. If they don't like it, that's too bad.</p>\n<p>If you plan to cut family members you normally shop for from your list, it might be wise to let them know ahead of time — especially if they also buy gifts for you or your family. Most people will understand you're trying to spend less and avoid debt this year if you reach out and explain the situation. </p>\n<p>Either way, decide who you want to shop for and remove everyone else from the list. Then you can decide how to divvy up your holiday budget for each person that's left. Maybe you have two children and allocate $150 to each of them while setting aside $20 per person for other people on your list. Whatever it is, put your budget and plan in writing so you can stick to it. </p>\n<h2>5. Shop sales to make your money stretch further</h2>\n<p>Having an idea of how much you plan to spend on family and friends is the best way to avoid going over your budget this holiday season. When you know for a fact you have $20 per person to spend on family members, you're in a better position to shop for gifts in that price range instead of overspending, or winging it as you go.</p>\n<p>While Black Friday and Cyber Monday tend to bring excellent prices and sales on everything from electronics to clothing and home decor, don't forget to keep an eye out for low prices for anything you want to buy. The internet is your friend when it comes to searching for deals and comparing prices across multiple stores. You can even sign up for the Honey app, which finds the best coupon code and automatically applies it to your cart whenever you shop online. </p>\n<h2>6. Have a plan to avoid debt when you buy gifts</h2>\n<p>You may plan to use debit cards for online purchases and cash when you shop in stores this year, and that's perfectly okay. Just remember that, as a general rule, credit cards are considerably safer when it comes to online purchases due to the way the <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0213-lost-or-stolen-credit-atm-and-debit-cards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCBA)</a> protects against fraudulent purchases. </p>\n<p>If you decide to pay with credit in order to rack up cash back or qualify for consumer protections like extended warranties or <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-credit-cards-protect-your-purchases-from-damage-or-theft?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">purchase protection</a>, make sure you only charge gifts you planned for in your holiday budget ahead of time. Also make sure you pay your credit card bill in full as soon as it arrives. As holiday shoppers from years past willingly admit, it's far too easy to let year-end bills linger. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Don't feel guilty about logging on when you're out in nature! There are more and more apps out there that can seriously enhance your outdoor experience, rather than distract from it — whether you need a map that still works offline, an audio guide for your earbuds, or help figuring out whether you just stepped in poison ivy or a harmless shrub. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/10-smartphone-apps-that-can-help-you-in-an-emergency?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Smartphone Apps That Can Help You in an Emergency</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Bivy</h2>\n<p>A bivy is a lightweight personal shelter you can carry around while backpacking. Consider the free <a href=\"https://www.bivy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bivy app</a> a lightweight outdoor adventure guidebook. You can pull up the app when you're in a new area looking for a good hike, climb, or paddle. Better yet, you can use the app to record and share your adventures with fellow nature lovers.</p>\n<p>This app also tells you when you're off the track, which, in my experience, would be pretty darn useful. Just last weekend, my husband, kids, and I were trying to hike to a waterfall using directions my husband had found online. We followed the landmarks, walked the recommended distance, and never found a waterfall. We still aren't sure what we did wrong. Next time, we'll use Bivy.

PlantSnap Plant Identification</h2>\n<p>There are several apps out there purporting to tell you what bush or tree you're looking at through photo recognition, but <a href=\"https://plantsnap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PlantSnap</a> gets the best reviews from the most users on the iTunes App Store and the Google Play Store.</p>\n<p>The developer claims that the app recognizes 90 percent of all plant and tree species on the planet, although according to reviews, it's a bit hit-or-miss. Still, if you love to take pictures of pretty flowers and shrubs, but never know what they're called, it's worth a try at $3.99 on iTunes or free on Google Play.

HERE WeGo</h2>\n<p>Billed as a free city navigation app, <a href=\"https://wego.here.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HERE WeGo</a> can also be useful for deep woods hikes for one important reason: It lets you download maps even when you're offline. Save your destination on the map before leaving civilization, then hike without worry that you'll lose your connection when you need it most. This feature also makes HERE WeGo handy for international travel, if you don't have a data plan abroad.

Just Ahead</h2>\n<p>I'm famous for missing wild animal sightings — or tripping over my own feet — because my nose is buried in a guidebook. <a href=\"https://www.justahead.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Just Ahead</a> allows you to keep your head up and listen to an audio guide to a number of National Parks, including Yosemite, Zion, the Grand Canyon, and more. If the price seems high for an app (the app is free but each travel guide is an in-app purchase up to $19.99), keep in mind that these tours are professionally written and narrated by experts who have written for <em>National Geographic</em> and other publications.</p>\n<p>And don't worry about losing your connection out on the trail; the guide will download to your phone and keep working out of cell tower range.

Sky Guide or Star Walk 2</h2>\n<p>Both of these apps use your phone's GPS and the concept of augmented reality to show you the stars and other celestial bodies that hover in the direction your phone is pointed.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>The reason I'm listing both is that <a href=\"http://www.fifthstarlabs.com/sky-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Sky Guide</a> (for $2.99), made by Fifth Star Labs, is not available for Android. Instead, Android users (and iOS users) can try <a href=\"http://www.vitotechnology.com/star-walk-2-guide-sky-night-day.html\" target=\"_blank\">Star Walk 2</a>, by Vito Technology, which is available in both free and $2.99 versions.</p>\n<h2>6. Maprika</h2>\n<p>Billed as a ski app, <a href=\"http://www.maprika.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maprika</a> is actually much more. It will not only help you navigate hiking and biking trails, it can even help you find the bathrooms at a theme park or guide you around a college campus. The best part of Maprika is that it shows you exactly where you are on the map, just like the big, friendly, \"YOU ARE HERE\" points on board maps in public places. And if you're with a group that splits up, you can track your friends (or your kids) on the map, as well.

ChirpOMatic or Bird Song ID</h2>\n<p>As with the sky mapping apps, the best app in this category, <a href=\"http://www.chirpomatic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ChirpOMatic</a>, is only available for the iPhone at $3.99. So Android users looking for the same features use <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.isoperla.birdsongidusa\" target=\"_blank\">Bird Song ID</a>, for $4.99.</p>\n<p>Sometimes referred to as \"Shazam for birds,\" these apps let you record bird calls, then they analyze the sound and guess what bird you're hearing. Like plant recognition apps, these are used with varying success; some reviewers love them and others end up frustrated.</p>\n<h2>8. AllTrails</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AllTrails</a> is a popular map app that covers the basics you would expect, like helping you find a promising trail and giving you directions along the way. One thing users love is seeing other users' comments; a recent review can save you from trying to hike a path that's covered in snow or searching for a waterfall that dried up a few years ago. With more than 50,000 ratings on iTunes, your chances are good that another user has recently tread the path you wish to explore.</p>\n<p>The paid Pro version (for $29.99 per year) allows you to download offline maps, create custom maps, and to create real-time map overlays, showing conditions such as heat or air quality along your route — all without the ads you'll have to endure on the free version.

The idea behind the open floor plan is to encourage collaboration and teamwork among employees, rather than having walls that literally divide people. The design also helps companies save on the amount of office space needed to accommodate everyone. Individual offices take up much more space, and therefore cost companies more money to rent and fill.</p>\n<p>While some people love working in an open office layout, it certainly isn't a fit for everyone. Some people thrive among the constant chatter and collaboration of coworkers, while others find it distracting.</p>\n<p>If an open office setting is preventing you from accomplishing your to-do list each day, there are ways you can make it easier on yourself. Here are six simple ways to stay focused while working in an open office.</p>\n<h2>1. Get some fresh air</h2>\n<p>When the office is full of distractions, it is sometimes best to walk away for a minute to clear your mind. The best way to do this is to step outside for some fresh air. A deep breath of nature can restore the mind from the mental fatigue of work, allowing you to return to your tasks with a fresh perspective and decreased stress.</p>\n<p>In fact, Steve Jobs of Apple was notorious for holding walking meetings in order to spend more time outdoors.

Invest in headphones</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KtocXM\" target=\"_blank\">Noise-canceling headphones</a> are a lifesaver when it comes to eliminating distractions. Not only do they help drown out office chatter, but they also signify to others that you're trying to work. People tend to interrupt you less if they see that you're wearing headphones and are in work mode.</p>\n<p>Further, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04255\" target=\"_blank\">research conducted Cornell University in 2016</a> shows that \"streamlined\" music can help improve your focus at work, and your mood — giving you all the more reason to crank your favorite tunes. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/this-is-the-best-music-to-listen-to-if-you-want-to-be-productive?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">This Is the Best Music to Listen to If You Want to Be Productive</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. Establish boundaries</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the best open office survival tip is to establish boundaries with those around you. There's no shame in letting people know how you work best. You're there to do a job, and if the open office layout is becoming a distraction, it's up to you to find a way to make it work.</p>\n<p>Block off an hour or two a day on your calendar that is strictly dedicated to working on your own. Share your calendar with others so they know when you are or aren't available. And chances are, you aren't the only person in your office struggling with the open concept. Lead the charge by creating an office plan of how to let one another know when you're busy. Perhaps you put a do not disturb sign up while you are occupied, or you ask everyone on your team to coordinate an hour of distraction-free work. Whatever the case, find something that works for you and your coworkers.</p>\n<h2>4. Ask for emails</h2>\n<p>How can anyone get anything done when coworkers are constantly stopping by or pinging you on Slack? The truth is, it's difficult for anyone to work with constant interruptions.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there's another form of communication can help prevent interruptions: email. Most things aren't urgent, so it's okay to ask your coworkers to email you instead of verbally asking you, or messaging you. By requesting emails, you can respond when it works for you and better establish your priorities. Plus, you can close your email when you're working to eliminate yet another distraction. If someone really needs to speak with you, encourage them to email you and setup a time to speak later in the day.

Find an alternative workspace</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, it may be impossible to accomplish your objectives in an open office atmosphere. If this is the case, talk to your boss about finding an alternative workspace to use when you seriously need to concentrate. Whether you need a private conference room for a few hours or the chance to work from home once a week, come up with a few options to present to your manager.</p>\n<p>If all else fails, you can always ask to move to a cubical that faces the wall. These are often less distracting since you don't see everyone in the office while you work. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/14-reasons-your-boss-should-let-you-work-from-home?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">14 Reasons Your Boss Should Let You Work From Home</a>)</p>\n<h2>6. Practice tolerance</h2>\n<p>After setting some established boundaries, your coworkers should better be able to accommodate your need for privacy. However, no one is perfect. Respect and tolerance goes both ways in the workplace.</p>\n<p>While it might not be an ideal situation for you at all times, try to see the benefit of your office layout. Understand that no matter your work setup, everyone you work with communicates differently.

These so-called \"death dinners\" allow people to discuss and ultimately plan for the inevitable in a way that can be positive, life-affirming, and even a little bit fun.</p>\n<p>Rather than avoid talking about a difficult subject, a death dinner can give you the space you need to consider some tough questions with friends and loved ones. Here's why you might want to consider hosting such a dinner, and how you can make sure you and your guests get the most out of your evening.</p>\n<h2>Why would you want to host a death dinner?</h2>\n<p>Family dinner conversations about the end of life might sound uncomfortable — or perhaps a total drag — but holding such a dinner may make a difficult topic easier to grapple with.</p>\n<p>According to Michael Hebb, founder of the <a href=\"https://deathoverdinner.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Death Over Dinner</a> movement, \"The dinner table is the most forgiving place for difficult conversations.\" Sharing food fosters a connection among diners, which can empower everyone involved to open up about their fears, hopes, and ideas.</p>\n<p>It can also help you and your guests understand some of the issues that you'll face as you come to the end of your life or a loved one's life. We don't know what we don't know, especially about a topic as hard to discuss as death. Having an opportunity to discuss these issues openly can help illuminate the gaps in your understanding of end-of-life planning, while simultaneously helping you to feel close to your fellow dinner companions.</p>\n<h2>How can you introduce such an awkward conversation?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of ways you can plan these events to help ensure a lively and meaningful discussion. First, you may want to prepare some icebreaker questions. </p>\n<p>Some common conversation starters for such a dinner include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you had a funeral, would you want it to be fun or more traditional?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>What do you want to do with all your belongings?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Do you have a will?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Would you rather write your own obituary or entrust it with someone else? Who would that be?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Would you want any other funeral events, such as a wake or luncheon?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the Death Over Dinner program also provides hosts with reading material, a video, and a podcast to share with your dinner guests ahead of the meal. These materials can form the basis of your conversation over dinner, and give you an opportunity to talk about what decisions you will need to make.</p>\n<p>You can choose ahead of time which end-of-life topic you're most interested in discussing at your dinner party and choose the materials that fit best. That means you can steer your dinner party toward topics such as the environmental impact of various burial and cremation options, how to plan ahead for the financial impact of your death, or philosophical questions about end-of-life.</p>\n<h2>Talking about death can help you plan ahead</h2>\n<p>A death dinner can not only help demystify an important part of our lives, but you can use it as an opportunity to discuss which documents and policies help people prepare for the end of life. According to the <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/getting-your-affairs-order\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Institute on Aging</a>, here are a few that may be worth highlighting at your death dinner.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>An In Case of Emergency document</h3>\n<p>This is a rundown of all the personal information your family or executor would need after your death. This includes things like Social Security numbers, the location of your will and other legal documents, logins to online accounts, personal contacts, and the names and contact information for any professionals who have helped create your estate plan (such as your lawyer, insurance agent, accountant, etc). </p>\n<h3>Financial documents and asset information</h3>\n<p>When someone passes away, there are typically three questions that follow: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where is their money? <br>\n     </li>\n<li>What did they have of value? <br>\n     </li>\n<li>What debt will need to be addressed? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some debt can be forgiven when someone dies, and knowing the financial history of the deceased may help ensure everything is covered. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/11-essential-documents-you-should-keep-in-your-safe?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11 Essential Documents You Should Keep in Your Safe</a>)</p>\n<h3>Wills and trusts</h3>\n<p>These documents often go much deeper than just who inherits your belongings. Consider discussing the difference between wills and trusts, and the process in which these wishes become legally binding.</p>\n<p>Talking about how to create and organize these kinds of documents can help insure you and your guests are prepared in case of a sudden death. Adding the stress of trying to handle post-death financial chores without these documents on top of bereavement is a burden that you and your guests can help avoid by having a frank conversation about their importance.

Having such a conversation over dinner also removes some of the stigma and pain of discussing death. That makes it more likely that you can have a meaningful and life-affirming conversation about death with people you care about.</p>\n<p>Though it may feel odd to plan such a dinner party, having a death dinner can inspire you and other dinner guests to start making appropriate arrangements while you still have time to think them through. And that is an incredible gift to your loved ones.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

No two people are going to see eye-to-eye on every aspect of money management, and since finances can be such a volatile topic, any money misalignment between two people can cause a great deal of friction.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, money arguments can often be much harder to navigate than your garden-variety disagreements. </p>\n<p>Here are some of the most common money arguments you may have to deal with, and how you can nip them in the bud before they interfere with your relationships.

They might propose going out to eat at Cafe Riche where cocktails are $25 each and the entrees don't even have prices listed — while you were hoping to share a pitcher of beer and a plate of nachos at the local dive bar where no one blinks when you pay with sofa-cushion change.</p>\n<p>It can feel awkward to ask your monocle-wearing friends if you can change the venue, but going to their preferred spot to pick at the cheapest side salad on the menu is a recipe for resentment. Especially if they suggest splitting the bill evenly at the end of the night.</p>\n<p>You may worry that you're in for a fight no matter what you do, since pointing out the differences in your spending habits can end with hurt feelings. However, it is possible to get ahead of these potential arguments before they become a problem.</p>\n<p>To start, you could simply state out loud that you're working with a tighter budget than you'd like, so you're hoping to have fun on the cheap. If that doesn't feel comfortable — not all friends are at the \"sharing their financial reality\" level of intimacy, after all — then consider suggesting fun activities that are free or cheap, and simply bowing out of the reservations at Chateau du Moolah. </p>\n<p>Finally, if you do end up tagging along to some of the expensive restaurants, ask for separate checks when you order, rather than wait for the awkward moment at the end of the meal.

Whether the money is going toward education, a new gadget, groceries, or clothes, one person may feel that the other is being completely irrational. The spender might feel like the saver is either a buzzkill or unsupportive, while the saver may think the spender is irresponsible and doesn't care about their future.</p>\n<p>This kind of argument can be easily averted with separate fun money funds. Making sure each person has their own fun money can allow them to make purchases the other might see as unnecessary, without it becoming an issue.</p>\n<p>It gets much thornier when larger spending priorities are misaligned. If you and your partner cannot agree on how much to spend on things like education, career needs, food, or the like, then having separate funds cannot solve the problem.</p>\n<p>This is when it makes sense to talk about the basis of your spending priorities. If you feel strongly that you should pay for your child's education and your spouse disagrees, taking the time to talk about what those actions would mean for each of you can help you figure out what you're each trying to accomplish. Knowing the <em>why</em> behind your spending priorities can help you find common ground that will lead to a compromise.

And if you do decide to loan money, you may find yourself silently judging every financial choice they make while you wait for repayment, and wondering when and how you can ask for the money back.</p>\n<p>The best way to nip arguments about loans in the bud is to set clear expectations in advance. </p>\n<p>To start, that means saying no if you're unable to extend the loan. If you're not in a position to lend money to your loved one — whether it's your financial situation or your emotional situation — then you need to tell them that you can't help them that way. Don't say you can't afford to loan them money, since that can be construed as an invitation for your would-be borrower to question every purchase you make. You can make it clear that you do care about their situation by asking if there are any non-financial ways you can help.</p>\n<p>If you do decide to loan them money, treat it like a formal loan. Tell your borrower that you require a written contract with the repayment terms spelled out, including what will happen in case of a missed payment. There are free templates for promissory notes available online that can help you draw up the contract. Having this in place will make it clear to your borrower that you're treating the loan as a serious transaction. These boundaries will also ensure that you preserve the relationship.</p>\n<p>If your loved one feels affronted by these terms, remember that you don't need to manage their reaction to your financial requirements. They are the potential borrower, which means you, as the lender, get to set the terms of the loan. </p>\n<h2>Don't let money get in the way of your relationships</h2>\n<p>In a perfect world, money would never come between you and your loved ones. But in the real world, money disagreements can cause a great deal of resentment and distress. However, setting firm boundaries and talking openly about your priorities can help you keep money arguments from turning extremely ugly.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

This estimate doesn't even include extra expenditures on gas, dining, or holiday travel. </p>\n<p>This means that, like it or not, most of us are spending a hefty sum of cash on gifts for family and friends. And many of us are paying the high costs of holiday travel on top of that, whether it's for a road trip, a flight across the world, or a holiday soirÃ©e with extended family closer to home. </p>\n<p>If you've set money aside all year long, this may not surprise you or throw your budget far off track. However, it would be a shame not to maximize the extra purchases you'll need to make anyway — especially since you can leverage holiday bills to earn more points and miles. </p>\n<h2>Use holiday spending to earn major points</h2>\n<p>By and large, the best way to earn more cash back or travel rewards is by using a rewards credit card for everything you buy. Most of the top rewards and <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel credit cards</a> give you one to three points for each dollar you spend, making it easy to rack up more and more points when you have big upcoming expenses, like the holidays.</p>\n<p>However, you can boost your rewards quite a bit if you leverage holiday spending to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/dont-make-these-6-credit-card-sign-up-bonus-mistakes?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earn a sign-up bonus</a> on a new card. Many of the top cards offer 50,000 points or more if you can spend a few thousand dollars within a few months, and holiday spending could easily help you reach the required threshold. </p>\n<p>Also note that you could use holiday travel bills to start racking up another type of rewards if you're ready to diversify. You could sign up for an airline credit card that doles out airline miles, for example, a hotel credit card, or a card that earns flexible travel credit. </p>\n<h2>Earn more points on holiday dining</h2>\n<p>Like it or not, holiday shopping and other events can easily cause families to dine out more than normal. If you want to capitalize on your extra meals out, you can always sign up for an airline dining program like <a href=\"https://skymilesdining.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Delta SkyMiles Dining</a> or <a href=\"https://www.rapidrewardsdining.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining</a>. </p>\n<p>These <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-airline-dining-rewards-programs?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">airline dining programs</a> and others let you earn miles each time you dine at a participating restaurant and pay with a credit card connected to your account. Some also offer a \"sign-up bonus\" of sorts. With Delta SkyMiles Dining, for example, you can currently earn 3,000 bonus miles when you spend at least $30 at three participating restaurants and complete online reviews for each within 30 days. </p>\n<h2>Use shopping portals for all your holiday shopping</h2>\n<p>If you shop online, you'll absolutely want to figure out which portals can help you earn the most points and miles — or at least the type of points and miles you want to earn. Most major airlines have <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-use-airline-shopping-portals-to-cash-in-on-rewards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their own shopping portals</a>, but hotel brands and bank-based loyalty programs have them too. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>While you can earn airline miles or hotel points through shopping portals without having a co-branded credit card in most cases, you'll need to have the right credit card to earn bank-based rewards. </p>\n<p>Regardless, shopping portals all work in the same way. To earn bonus points, all you have to do is log into your account and \"click through\" the portal before you shop online with a participating store. You’ll find common big name stores such as Kohl's, Macys, Home Depot, and Best Buy. And remember, the bonus points you earn by shopping in a portal are offered <em>on top of </em>rewards you earn by paying with a rewards credit card. </p>\n<h2>Take advantage of category bonuses</h2>\n<p>Remember to check if any of your rewards cards offer bonus categories that might line up nicely with your holiday shopping or travel plans. Credit cards with <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-credit-cards-with-rotating-reward-categories?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rotating categories</a> generally have popular stores for their 4th quarter bonus categories.</p>\n<h2>Use portals when you book holiday travel</h2>\n<p>Finally, don't forget that you can earn extra points and miles when you book and pay for holiday travel for yourself and your family. You'll just have to get creative and do some research to figure out the best way to make the most of your plans.</p>\n<p>Let's say you want to rack up more points in the <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/best-domestic-frequent-flyer-program-southwest-airlines-rapid-rewards-premier-credit-card?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southwest Rapid Rewards program</a>, for example. In this case, you'll probably be delighted to know that you can earn Southwest points if you log into your account and use their portal to book rental cars, vacation packages, hotels, and more. In fact, most airline programs let you earn miles when you use them to book rental cars, hotels, and other travel accommodations, so make sure to check with your favorite program. </p>\n<p>Keep in mind that a handful of hotel booking websites let you earn airline miles for booking hotels. PointsHound and Rocketmiles are two of the most popular, both letting you earn thousands of miles per night in programs like Etihad Guest, Air France/Flying Blue, and Southwest Rapid Rewards. </p>\n<p>And make sure you have a rewards card that will give you extra points when you fill up your gas tank, particularly if you're planning a holiday road trip. A handful of <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-cash-back-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cash back credit cards</a> offer bonus points for gas purchases each year with no annual fee, making them a no-brainer. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Every member of his crew plugs their ears with beeswax so they can't hear the tempting song, and Odysseus latches himself tightly to the mast of his ship, so that he cannot escape and steer the ship off course. With a little forethought, Odysseus manages to be the only human who hears the sirens' song and lives to tell the tale.</p>\n<p>Odysseus's scheme is an excellent example of what behavioral economists and social scientists call \"pre-commitment mechanisms.\" These mechanisms can be powerful tools in helping people overcome impulsive behavior, and specifically, overspending.</p>\n<p>Here's what you need to know about pre-commitment mechanisms and how you can incorporate them into your financial decisions. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-mental-biases-that-are-keeping-you-poor?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Mental Biases That Are Keeping You Poor</a>)</p>\n<h2>Why do pre-commitments work?</h2>\n<p>According to Dr. Daniel Crosby, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2oKxbOm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Behavioral Investor</a>, \"pre-commitment works because it takes natural (and sometimes negative) human tendencies like laziness and status quo bias and actually makes them work for us.\"</p>\n<p>Since we're likely to let a previous decision stand if it keeps us from having to make a new decision, we can profit from our own laziness. For instance, someone trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle may not keep donuts or ice cream in their home as a pre-commitment to eating better. Since getting junk food requires leaving the house, the pre-commitment of not buying treats can often be enough to keep sweets out of their diet.</p>\n<p>Pre-commitments can help align your long-term goals with your short-term decisions. Dr. Crosby writes that \"a pre-commitment should be used anytime we feel our short-term preferences may change, but our hope is for our long-term commitments to mirror our current frame of mind.\" </p>\n<p>This means that anyone who'd like to spend less, make rational investment choices, or pay down debt could benefit from creating pre-commitment mechanisms.</p>\n<h2>What does a pre-commitment mechanism look like?</h2>\n<p>There are multiple ways to create a pre-commitment mechanism to keep you on track to accomplishing your goals.</p>\n<h3>Social consequences</h3>\n<p>Many successful budgeters blog about their <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/fastest-way-to-pay-off-10000-in-credit-card-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">journey out of debt</a> or toward financial independence. These budgeters are pre-committing to social consequences if they should fall off the debt-repayment wagon. The negative social consequences of reneging on the publicly stated goals are much stronger than the immediate temptation to spend, which helps those who share their goals publicly to stay on track.</p>\n<p>In the modern world, there are a number of ways to use social consequences as a pre-commitment to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-use-financial-anchors-to-make-better-money-decisions?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improving your spending habits</a>. For instance, you can set up an automated alert from your bank or credit card issuer that texts your spouse anytime you make a transaction larger than a certain amount. The social consequences of having to explain your purchase to your spouse can be enough to make you pause before buying anything.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can also seek out accountability partners via social networks or take a page from debt bloggers and record your journey in a blog.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Automation</h3>\n<p>Having your savings taken automatically from your checking account allows you to pre-commit to a savings strategy that's harder to undo. This automated decision allows you to benefit from your own disinclination to change the default setting. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-ways-to-automate-your-finances?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Ways to Automate Your Finances</a>)</p>\n<p>According to Dr. Crosby, one of the most famous examples of a pre-commitment mechanism is the <a href=\"http://www.shlomobenartzi.com/save-more-tomorrow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Save More Tomorrow</a> program, popularized by Richard Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi: </p>\n<p>\"It involves pre-commiting to the auto-withdrawal and auto-escalation of retirement savings over time. Effectively, it allows a retirement saver to make a good decision once that benefits them for the entirety of their savings lifetime. People are busy, their willpower is weak, and their decisions can be inconsistent. By 'setting and forgetting' decisions like saving and escalating retirement contributions, human frailty gets turned on its head.\" </p>\n<h3>Remove temptations</h3>\n<p>Another pre-commitment option is to change your environment so that you encounter fewer temptations. This is what the dieter who has no sweet treats at home is doing. Reformed spenders can do the same by taking their credit card out of their wallet. (There's a very good reason for the old-fashioned advice about freezing your credit card in a block of ice.)</p>\n<p>Similarly, removing your payment information from your favorite online retail sites, unsubscribing from retail email newsletters, and immediately recycling paper catalogs you receive can all help you avoid the siren song of spending.</p>\n<h2>When pre-commitments don't work</h2>\n<p>While setting up pre-commitment mechanisms can do a great deal to help you improve your financial life, they're not magic. A pre-commitment that can be undone will be undone if it's easy for you to change your commitment when you're feeling tempted.</p>\n<p>Dr. Crosby has seen that creating rules-based pre-commitment strategies often does little to stop investors from reacting emotionally. \"Jim O'Shaughnessy, the godfather of quantitative investing, recently revealed that 60 percent of rules-based traders broke their rules during the Great Recession, effectively nullifying their pre-commitment (which is all an automated, quantitative strategy really is).\"</p>\n<p>These traders had pre-committed to a kind of \"if this, then that\" rules system for investing. But when they got scared about their investments, they ignored the rules they had committed to. Because they could break their own rules, these traders did so, despite their pre-commitment to more rational investment choices.</p>\n<p>This is why Dr. Crosby recommends making your pre-commitments difficult to alter. \"Once you've made a commitment, you want it to be as hard as possible to change it. Make that choice and lose the key!\"</p>\n<h2>Know your temptations</h2>\n<p>Pre-commitments can help you protect yourself from making easy, habitual, lazy, emotional, or poorly-thought-out decisions. But your pre-commitments will be more effective if you know which temptations are most likely to affect you, and if you make your pre-commitments difficult to change.</p>\n<p>Be like Odysseus, and outsmart your worst impulses before you have a chance to indulge them.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Travel credit cards can be especially lucrative, since you can earn <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/9-ways-to-use-travel-rewards-cards-to-get-free-trips?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">airline miles for free flights</a>, hotel points good for free stays all over the world, and flexible travel points you can use in more than one way.</p>\n<p>For a lot of consumers, travel rewards help them see the world. They may not be able to travel for as long, or as far away from home, without the points and miles they earn using their rewards cards for regular expenses and bills. </p>\n<p>In that sense, some people start to think of their rewards stash as an extension of their travel budget. And that's perfectly okay. The thing is, travel rewards cards can do<em> a lot</em> more than make travel free; they can make it more luxurious, more comfortable, and a lot more fun. Here are a few examples. </p>\n<h2>Upgrade to business class</h2>\n<p>Most of us who work diligently to save up for a vacation would never be able to afford business class tickets, and especially not for overseas travel. Fortunately, airline and <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel rewards cards</a> make it easy to earn <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-credit-cards-that-offer-bonus-cash-for-sign-up?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">big sign-up bonuses</a> and ongoing rewards that can make paying for a business class seat a reality.</p>\n<p>While business class flights can vary depending on the airline loyalty program, you can frequently find international business class tickets to destinations throughout Europe for just over 55,000 American AAdvantage miles one-way, for example. Air France/Flying Blue often offers similar pricing, and their Promo Awards often include special international deals.</p>\n<h2>Book hotels you couldn't normally afford</h2>\n<p>Hotel points can be used for regular hotels nearly anywhere in the world, but don't forget that with enough points, you can stay in over-the-top properties you could never afford to pay for with cash. </p>\n<p>Imagine staying in a luxury resort in the Maldives, Bora Bora, or the Seychelles, and all on points. This is absolutely possible thanks to hotel loyalty programs and co-branded credit cards from Hilton Honors, World of Hyatt, IHG Rewards, and Marriott Bonvoy. </p>\n<p>I've done this before, and the one downside you'll face is higher costs for food and fun. When I used World of Hyatt points to stay at the $900+ per night Park Hyatt Paris-Vendome, for example, drinks at the bar started at around $39 USD. My husband and I were too embarrassed to get up and walk out after we were already seated and perusing the menu, so we shared the cheapest drink we could buy — a glass of rosÃ©. From that point on, we ordered drinks elsewhere. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-amazing-travel-destinations-you-thought-were-unaffordable?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Amazing Travel Destinations You Thought Were Unaffordable</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Splurge for trip excursions</h2>\n<p>Another rewards strategy to try is <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/once-in-a-lifetime-experiences-ive-earned-with-credit-card-rewards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earning points for luxury splurges</a>, tours, and day trips. This is something I frequently do with flexible travel credit I earn.</p>\n<p>No matter where in the world you're traveling, you can use certain types of points to book fun stuff like snorkeling excursions, museum tours, foodie tours, and more. For an upcoming trip to Italy I have on the books, for example, I redeemed points for a cooking class in Florence, a winery tour and gourmet dinner in Tuscany, and private airport pickup in Milan. I also cashed in some rewards for a golf cart tour of ancient Rome — which is a must considering we're taking my aging parents with us, and they would not enjoy walking all over such a large, sprawling area to see the major sites. </p>\n<p>Remember, travel rewards can be used for travel essentials like flights and hotels, but they can also be used for fun splurges you wouldn't want to pay for otherwise. </p>\n<h2>Speed through airport security</h2>\n<p>Many of the top travel rewards credit cards available today also offer a credit for <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/best-credit-cards-that-offer-tsa-pre-check-and-global-entry-reimbursement?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TSA Precheck or Global Entry</a>. Where TSA Precheck helps you speed through airport security without having to remove your shoes, belt, or laptop from your bag, Global Entry can help you re-enter the United States without having to stand in ridiculously long lines.</p>\n<p>Both of these perks have saved me time, but especially Global Entry. Where most people wait at least 30 minutes (and sometimes hours) to re-enter the United States after traveling abroad, I rarely wait in line for more than five minutes. </p>\n<h2>Enjoy endless airport lounges</h2>\n<p>After you've skipped waiting in line thanks to Global Entry or TSA Precheck, you can head to the safe and quiet refuge of an airport lounge.</p>\n<p>Many top travel credit cards offer <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-credit-cards-with-free-airport-lounge-access?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">airport lounge access</a> as a cardholder perk. Some cards even let you gain entry into thousands of airport lounges around the world. All of these lounges have a selection of drinks and snacks, but some of the best have expansive buffets and free-flowing booze. It really depends on the airport. </p>\n<p>Either way, you're better off in a lounge than you are sitting at the crowded, loud gate waiting for your flight. Since many top travel credit cards offer airport lounge access for free as a cardholder perk, you may as well take advantage while you can. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

For that reason and plenty of others, savvy consumers tend to pay for travel insurance before they even head to the airport.</p>\n<p>With a travel insurance plan, you can buy coverage that will reimburse if you if your trip is canceled or delayed for a covered reason beyond your control. You can even purchase \"cancel for any reason\" policies that let you back out of your trip any time you want. </p>\n<p>Other inclusions travel insurance policies offer include medical coverage, baggage delay coverage, lost luggage insurance, travel accident insurance, and more. </p>\n<p>Many consumers lean on the free travel insurance their credit cards provide — and that can sometimes make sense. After all, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">premier travel credit cards</a> offer most of the coverage you get with a travel insurance policy for free. And if you can get insurance for free, why pay for it?</p>\n<p>The reality is, there are a ton of <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-pick-a-travel-insurance-policy?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reasons to buy travel insurance</a> even if you get some coverage with a credit card. Here are a few of the most important details to consider as you plan your next trip.</p>\n<h2>Pay for sufficient medical coverage</h2>\n<p>Even though travel credit cards are pretty good about offering perks like trip cancellation/interruption insurance and baggage delay coverage, they're notoriously bad when it comes to offering medical coverage. That's a real problem if you're traveling to a destination where your own health insurance coverage won't work, such as any trip abroad.</p>\n<p>With travel insurance, however, you can buy a policy that offers a much higher limits for medical expenses. It wouldn't take long to rack up huge medical bills if you wind up in the hospital due to illness or broken bones during your trip, but you can protect yourself with adequate travel insurance coverage that includes coverage for medical bills. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-emergency-medical-coverage-could-save-your-vacation?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Emergency Medical Coverage Could Save Your Vacation</a>) </p>\n<h2>You need medical evacuation coverage</h2>\n<p>In addition to medical coverage, you'll want to make sure you have adequate coverage for medical evacuation. This type of coverage will kick in if you become injured or ill and require emergency transportation to get back home. This could mean emergency evacuation in a plane or helicopter with a full medical team, so it's easy to imagine just how much you'd be stuck paying if you didn't have this type of coverage.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Most credit cards don't offer emergency evacuation coverage and ones that do may not offer high enough limits to help you sleep well at night. If you're worried about the high cost of medical evacuation if you were to become sick or injured overseas, you'll want to buy travel insurance that includes this benefit. </p>\n<h2>Credit card coverage may not even apply</h2>\n<p>Also note that some credit card insurance coverage may not even be applicable to you. Primary auto rental coverage, which is a popular credit card benefit, is a great example of coverage that doesn't always work.</p>\n<p>Many credit card auto insurance policies only cover certain types of cars for certain amounts of time. For example, some cards only offer insurance for rental periods of 31 days or less. And some credit card auto insurance policies also limit the number of countries you can use your coverage in, meaning it may not work at all depending on where you travel to. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-times-travel-insurance-is-worth-it?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Times Travel Insurance Is Worth It</a>)</p>\n<h2>You may want higher coverage limits</h2>\n<p>A final reason to purchase travel insurance is the fact that you get to select your coverage limits. This is unlike credit card coverage since it gives you whatever limits your credit card issuer decides.</p>\n<p>For example, some cards offer free baggage insurance that can cover you if your baggage is lost by a common carrier. However, this benefit sometimes includes limits on the cost per person, per trip for carry-on baggage and checked bags, which may not be enough if you have brand-name luggage that would cost a lot more than that to replace. </p>\n<p>The same is true with trip cancellation/interruption insurance, which is one of the most important valuable travel benefits you can buy. Travel credit cards that offer this perk tend to limit it to $10,000 per person and $20,000 per trip, which may not be enough if you splurged for a luxurious trip of a lifetime. </p>\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n<p>There are times when it makes a lot of sense to rely on your credit card's insurance coverage, but you have to make sure you have the coverage you need with high enough limits to count. In many cases, credit card travel insurance just isn't enough.</p>\n<p>If you're on the fence about whether you have the coverage you need to protect yourself, you may want to buy a travel insurance policy just in case. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

(Mom really was right about washing your whites separately.) But one of the biggest challenges new college students face is figuring out how to manage their money.</p>\n<p>Learning how to make good financial decisions in your first year at college will not only set you up for success in school, but also for the rest of your life. Here are four important money moves that you should master during your first year of college. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/build-your-first-budget-in-5-easy-steps?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Build Your First Budget in 5 Easy Steps</a>)</p>\n<h2>Make friends with your financial aid office</h2>\n<p>It's common for college students to forget about their financial aid office, except when it's time to resubmit their FAFSA each year, and when they need to come in for the exit interview before graduation. However, getting to know your financial aid office can save you a great deal of heartache in the future.</p>\n<p>To start, a financial aid counselor can help you to understand exactly what to expect from your student loans. They can provide you with information about what your repayment will look like post-graduation so you can make more concrete decisions about taking on your loans.</p>\n<p>In addition, your financial aid office can help you determine if there are ways to mitigate your <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-unique-ways-millennials-are-dealing-with-student-loan-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">student loan debt</a>. It's also through your financial aid office that you'll learn about work-study jobs that can help you earn a little money without committing to a traditional part-time job.</p>\n<p>Making time for an appointment with your financial office once a year will help you feel more prepared for the costs of college and your post-college financial life.</p>\n<h2>Get the most from your meal plan</h2>\n<p>One of the perks of going to either a larger university or a school located in a major urban area is the meal plan. Many of these universities allow students to use their meal plan to purchase meals from fast food restaurants or buy items a la carte using a point system. </p>\n<p>The downside to this perk is the fact that your off-campus meal purchases can add up quickly. You may find yourself using up all of your meal plan long before the end of the semester, leaving you with the unenviable task of trying to feed yourself for the rest of the year on the cheap.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>It's better to learn early on exactly how far your meal plan will go, and decide ahead of time how many meals a week you can afford to treat yourself to from the local restaurants. </p>\n<h2>Save money</h2>\n<p>Saving can feel like an impossible task in college, since many college students already feel like they're living on a shoestring. If every penny you bring in is going toward your college expenses, how are you supposed to save money?</p>\n<p>But it's never too early to get a jump on <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-reasons-you-really-need-to-pay-yourself-first-seriously?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paying yourself first</a>. And college students can take advantage of the fact that small amounts can add up quickly. Start by opening a student savings account at your bank. These accounts will often require no minimum balances and have no fees, which will make it easy for you to practice your savings habit even when you're broke.</p>\n<p>Then start automatically transferring a small amount to your savings with every paycheck. Even automatic transfers as low as $5 to $20 can help you build a cushion that will help you weather an unexpected car repair bill or a higher-than-usual textbook cost. Then you can also start to add in any excess money you come across, like the cash you get for selling back textbooks or the tips you get at your restaurant job.</p>\n<h2>Plan for fun</h2>\n<p>College life offers a great deal of exciting things to do outside of studying, and that's why financially-savvy college students plan ahead for their fun.</p>\n<p>If you don't decide ahead of time what you're willing to spend your time and money on, it's much more difficult to refuse the last-minute invitation to go out. Without a plan in place, you'll be much more vulnerable to both peer pressure and the stress of studying. </p>\n<p>Instead, determine how much money and time you can spend on the non-scholarly part of college and stick to it. If your budget and study schedule can afford four nights out per month, then you can make sure you spend those nights doing something that actually gets you the best bang for your buck and enjoy your time away from the books.</p>\n<h2>Smart financial habits for life</h2>\n<p>Your first year of college is a great time to learn how to be an adult. Not only are you getting your first taste of being on your own, but the financial stakes are lower than they will be when you graduate. So you can set up your smart habits without feeling overwhelmed and get used to the kinds of decisions that will set you up for a life of healthy financial choices.

When I went to a party store to buy decorations for the event, I went a little overboard with balloons, streamers, hats, and kitsch. I'm only going to turn 40 once, after all, and I wanted to enjoy myself and throw a fun party.</p>\n<p>As I was cleaning up many of the unused decorations after the party, I realized I had fallen victim to one of the classic money blunders: using a special occasion as my rationale for overspending. </p>\n<p>Humans are good at coming up with rationalizations for spending money. But the lies we tell ourselves to excuse our spending are remarkably consistent, and we can recognize these rationalizations while they're happening. The next time you find yourself using one of the following excuses, stop and ask yourself if you're rationalizing your spending. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-mental-biases-that-are-keeping-you-poor?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Mental Biases That Are Keeping You Poor</a>)</p>\n<h2>\"It's a special occasion!\"</h2>\n<p>The special occasion excuse is the very reason the staff at the party supply store were so happy to see me. It feels wonderful to spend money to celebrate, whether you're marking a milestone birthday, giving holiday gifts to your loved ones, or commemorating a major life change like marriage or graduation. </p>\n<p>However, as good as it feels in the moment to spend money for these reasons, special occasion bills are just as painful to pay as any others. The boost you may feel for being the hostess with the mostest or the uncle who gives the best Christmas presents will have faded by the time your credit card payment is due. And that is hardly the way to ensure that you have happy memories of your special occasion.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself excusing your overspending because it's for something special, stop and think about what it is you truly want to get out of the occasion. Take a moment to recognize what feeling you want to evoke. Once you've figured that out, you can then determine how to do so without overspending.

Buying the single wrench would've set him back about $15. But when he got to the store, he found a 44-piece wrench set with every possible size he could ever need. The set cost $200, but he proudly told the family that the 5/16 inch wrench in the set only cost him $4.50. By spending $185 more than he planned, he saved $10.50 on the particular wrench he needed.</p>\n<p>We often rationalize a purchase with this kind of thinking. We tell ourselves that spending money we didn't intend to spend will somehow save us money in the future. And retailers are fully aware of our tendency to rationalize purchases as a way of saving money. (My stepfather's wrench set helpfully broadcast the fact that each wrench only cost $4.50 across the top.) </p>\n<p>Asking yourself the following questions can be a good method of breaking through your rationalizations:</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<ul>\n<li>Do I need this item?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Would I buy it if it weren't on sale or if it couldn't save me money?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Can I afford it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Had my stepfather asked himself these questions, he certainly would not have come home with a set of 44 wrenches that he didn't need.

Recognizing that you must prioritize your needs over your wants is the cornerstone of basic budgeting, and most people are well aware of the importance of doing this.</p>\n<p>The problem with the needs-versus-wants education is that it provides us with another ready-made rationalization for spending. Anytime we can convince ourselves that we <em>need</em> an item, there is very little to stop us from overspending.</p>\n<p>For instance, let's say your car is on its last legs. You need to get a new car because you have to have reliable transportation to get to work. But you convince yourself that you need a brand-new car rather than a reliable used one. You've tacked a want onto your legitimate need in order to justify your overspending to yourself.</p>\n<p>To avoid this rationalization, ask yourself if your need could be fulfilled with a less expensive option.</p>\n<h2>\"It's only $X.\"</h2>\n<p>Spending a little bit of unexpected money can feel like no big deal, since you're only parting with a five-spot or a tenner. If this only happens every once in a while, you might chalk it up to the cost of living. </p>\n<p>However, there are problems with the \"It's only $X\" rationalization. The first is that small amounts add up quickly. You can rationalize your way into some pretty hefty spending a couple of dollars at a time. </p>\n<p>In addition, what you consider a small amount of money changes with your budget. As you earn more money, you may go from thinking \"It's only $5\" to \"It's only $50.\" While you may have the income to absorb such a change in your \"It's only\" thinking, you're still spending more than you planned and it will add up even quicker at a higher income level.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself rationalizing a purchase with \"It's only $X,\" ask yourself what else you could do with the money. Thinking through what the loss of that money actually means to you can help you overcome the rationalization.

Taking the time to really ask yourself why you're making the choices you are can help to end your rationalizations and start looking at your finances more rationally.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

In fact, over 43 million adults owe on their student loans today, with a cumulative debt that is well over $1.5 trillion.</p>\n<p>Since it's nearly impossible to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy, unlucky borrowers with crushing debt levels have few options when it comes to finding a way out. They can pay off their loans the hard way, and there are federal repayment programs that can help ease the burden for those with <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/what-to-do-if-you-cant-pay-your-private-student-loan?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">federal student loans</a>. </p>\n<p>Students can also choose a different repayment timeline with federal loans or apply for certain types of employment that can help them qualify for forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).</p>\n<p>Some borrowers can also benefit from refinancing their student loans with a private lender, but there are some pitfalls with this strategy, too. You'll lose out on some federal protections when you refinance federal loans with a private lender, and there are steeper requirements to get approved.</p>\n<p>If you are considering refinancing your loans with a private lender to get out of debt faster or make repayment easier, here are some signs you may be on the right track. </p>\n<h2>1. You have an excellent credit score</h2>\n<p>While anyone can qualify for most federal student loans regardless of their credit score, most private student loans have stricter requirements. In fact, you typically need very good or excellent credit to qualify for the best private student loans, which typically means you'll need to have a FICO score of 740 or higher. </p>\n<p>Not all private lenders list a specific credit score requirement, however. <a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-2822544-12797287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SoFi</a>, for example, requires you to meet citizenship requirements, have a job, and have graduated from school with your degree. In terms of their credit requirements, they simply state that \"loan eligibility depends on a number of additional factors, including your financial history, credit score, career experience, and monthly income vs. expenses.\"</p>\n<p>In most cases, however, you'll need to have good credit to refinance with a private loan, or have access to a cosigner willing to be on the hook for repayment along with you.

You have no plans to take advantage of federal student loan benefits</h2>\n<p>One major downside that comes with refinancing federal student loans with a private lender is that you'll be effectively <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-valuable-rights-you-might-lose-when-you-refinance-student-loans?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"giving up\" federal loan benefits</a> like deferment and forbearance. You'll also give up your shot at qualifying for income-driven repayment plans, which can help you secure a lower monthly payment for 20-25 years before leading to ultimate student loan forgiveness.</p>\n<p>For that reason, refinancing with a private lender is usually best for borrowers who have no intention of using these benefits or needing to extend repayment by a decade or more to afford their loans. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/should-you-refinance-your-student-loan?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Should You Refinance Your Student Loan?</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. You want to consolidate your loans</h2>\n<p>If you have multiple student loans, you may want to consider consolidating them into a single new loan with one monthly payment. You can accomplish this goal with a federal Direct Consolidation Loan, but you can also consolidate multiple student loans — including both federal and private loans — with a private lender.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>The benefit of consolidating loans with a private lender is the fact that you may be able to qualify for a lower interest rate.

Your interest rate is high</h2>\n<p>Speaking of interest rates, this is one area where private student lenders can really shine — particularly if you have good credit. Federal student loan rates tend to be on the low side, but private student lenders still offer the better deal. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/this-is-how-student-loan-interest-works?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This Is How Student Loan Interest Works</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. You need a lower monthly payment</h2>\n<p>Refinancing your student loans can help you accomplish several different goals. You can save money on interest by securing a lower interest rate, for example, but you may also be able to pay down your debt faster.</p>\n<p>In some cases, it can also make sense to score a lower rate but extend your repayment timeline. The lower interest rate and lengthier repayment period can leave you with a lower monthly payment amount, which can help immensely if you are working toward earning a higher income or you need to save money to fund a goal like starting your own business.

You have a stable income</h2>\n<p>You do need a stable income to qualify for private student loan refinancing, which is vastly different from federal student loans that don't require an income at all. Private student loan refinancing is only available to people who have graduated with their degree in most cases, have a job (or a job lined up), and have provable income they can use to repay their loans.</p>\n<p>If you don't have a big income, you may want to wait until you're in a better, higher-paying job before you apply for private student loan refinancing.

If you want to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/15-ways-to-pay-back-student-loans-faster?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pay off your student loans faster</a>, have good credit and a high income, and you have a solid credit history, you may want to explore private lenders to see how they stack up.</p>\n<p>Just make sure to consider all the pitfalls, including the fact you'll no longer qualify for federal student loan benefits. This trade-off can be well worth it, but only if you have a plan. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

The United MileagePlus program announced it would move away from fixed awards earlier this year, for example, and so did Air France/Flying Blue in 2018. Some industry insiders are saying that the American AAdvantage program is next, although there's no formal announcement quite yet.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say you can't get a ton of value for your miles with dynamic award pricing. You absolutely can if you're flexible with your travel dates and willing to consider different destinations. Unfortunately, the loss of fixed award charts means that, in many cases, you won't know how many miles you'll need for a specific award until you are ready to book.</p>\n<p>This can be a big problem if you're trying to earn miles for a specific trip and can't really deviate from your plans — or if you're earning miles over an extremely long timeline. Without a fixed award chart, it's difficult to plan ahead or create a strategy to earn the miles you need.</p>\n<h2>How to beat dynamic award pricing</h2>\n<p>But what's a frequent flyer to do? Like it or not, dynamic award pricing is here to stay. All any of us can do is look for ways to get the most out of our airline miles in some way, shape, or form. And really, there are plenty of workarounds that can help you get extreme value from your miles — regardless of whether there's an award chart or not. Here are your best strategies to consider.</p>\n<h3>Earn a ton of airline miles</h3>\n<p>Whether your favorite airline offers fixed award charts or dynamic pricing, you'll always be better off if you have more miles to burn. That's why you should look for ways to earn more miles over time, via flying or through other means. Having more miles can be an insurance policy if you find that, at the last minute, a flight you wanted to book went up in miles overnight. </p>\n<p>There are many ways to earn more airline miles, and most of them don't even require you to board an airplane. For example, you could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick up an <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-co-branded-airline-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">airline credit card</a> that lets you earn miles for each dollar you spend.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Look for ways to cover more bills and regular expenses with your airline credit card.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-use-airline-shopping-portals-to-cash-in-on-rewards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">airline shopping portals</a> for all your online purchases.<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Join airline dining clubs so you're <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-airline-dining-rewards-programs?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rewarded with miles when you dine out</a> at participating restaurants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these strategies, there's one tried and true method that can easily yield a lot of airline miles in a hurry. Consider signing up for new <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel credit cards</a> with the goal of scoring a big sign-up bonus. Many <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-co-branded-airline-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">co-branded cards</a> will give you 50,000 miles and sometimes more if you can spend a few thousand dollars on your card within months of applying. Just make sure to pay your balance in full each month so you're never, ever paying interest on your purchases. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-maximize-rewards-through-credit-card-shopping-portals?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Maximize Rewards Through Credit Card Shopping Portals</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Focus on award sales and deals</h3>\n<p>Next up, it always makes sense to look for ways to stretch your miles. Some airlines, like Southwest, have frequent and ongoing sales that can let you book flights for fewer miles than normal, for example. All you have to do is keep your eye out so you can strike while the iron is hot.</p>\n<p>Other airlines like Delta Air Lines and Air France have their own \"deals pages\" that clue frequent flyers into their current list of specials. With <a href=\"https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/shop/deals-and-offers/north-america/skymiles-award-travel-deals.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Delta SkyMiles deals</a>, for example, you can frequently find round-trip international flights from specific airports to faraway destinations for as little as 14,000 miles plus taxes and fees. The catch is, you have to be willing to book right away, because these deals rarely last more than a week. </p>\n<p>Also, note that airfare \"deals\" are usually only from select airports and for a specific range of dates. With that in mind, you'll be in the best position to take advantage if you have some flexibility in your travel plans. </p>\n<h3>Rack up flexible travel points</h3>\n<p>Finally, there are so many reasons it can make sense to focus on <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/airline-credit-card-or-flexible-rewards-card-whats-the-best-way-to-earn-a-free-flight?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">flexible travel points</a>. Not only can you book travel directly through a portal with flexible points, but these programs let you transfer points to airlines and hotels.</p>\n<p>Having a huge stash of flexible points can help you ward off the negative effects of dynamic award pricing in a few ways. First, you can shop around among frequent flyer programs to see how many miles you'll need for the flight you want <em>before</em> you transfer them over. This lets you compare multiple airlines and go with the one charging the least number of miles.</p>\n<p>Flexible currencies also let you book airfare direct with any airline, which can be a good last option if you're not finding the award availability you want. Some cards even offer a discount if you go this route. </p>\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n<p>Don't let dynamic award pricing ruin your travel dreams. There are plenty of ways to maximize your miles with or without an award chart, and you can always focus on earning more miles just in case. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

After all, you'll need good credit if you hope to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-refinancing-an-auto-loan?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">take out a car loan</a>, rent an apartment, or get a mortgage to buy your first home. Believe it or not, your credit score can also impact how much you'll pay for auto insurance — and whether you get hired for certain jobs.</p>\n<p>If you hope to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/should-you-refinance-student-loans-with-a-balance-transfer-card?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">refinance your student loans</a> with a private lender to score a super-low interest rate, you'll need good credit for that. Want to take out a business loan and follow your dreams as an entrepreneur? You'll need good credit for that, too.</p>\n<p>The list of reasons to care about your credit score goes on and on, and the number of negative ways poor credit can impact your life is nearly endless, too. That's why, like it or not, we should all take steps to keep our credit scores in tip-top shape.</p>\n<h2>How your FICO score is determined</h2>\n<p>To accomplish this goal, however, it helps to know exactly where your credit score comes from. How can your entire credit history be represented by a three-digit number? And what factors can influence your score now and later on?</p>\n<p>The most popular type of credit score is <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/2-minute-read-what-you-need-to-know-about-fico-scores?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your FICO score</a>, and the FICO corporation offers some pretty straightforward answers when it comes to the factors they consider.</p>\n<p>The five factors that make up your FICO score include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Payment history: 35%</li>\n<li>Total amounts owed: 30%</li>\n<li>Length of credit history: 15%</li>\n<li>Credit mix: 10%</li>\n<li>New credit: 10%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you break down your FICO score this way, it's easy to see how you could use this information to your advantage. Overall, the best FICO scores go to those who learn to play by the rules with each of these factors and exhibit better credit behavior than most of their peers. </p>\n<h2>How to create an excellent payment history</h2>\n<p>Based on the above percentages, you'll see one factor that should be especially easy to stay on top of. It may take time to pay down debt to decrease the amounts you owe, but you should be able to pay your bills early or on time, right?</p>\n<p>Your payment history is one FICO score determinant that you have absolute control over, and this means you have the potential to make a big positive impact. To polish your payment history, make the following money moves.

You can typically do this by connecting your credit card accounts to your bank account and selecting automatic payments. While you can still pay your cards off manually each month, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-to-automate-credit-card-payments-and-rewards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">setting up auto payments</a> ensures you'll never be late if you simply forget.</p>\n<p>This strategy can be tricky if you rarely keep extra money in your bank account, however, so you may want to consider saving up a \"buffer\" so any automatic payments made don't cause an overdraft.</p>\n<h3>Pay your credit card bills more than once each month</h3>\n<p>If you're not interested in setting up automatic payments on your credit cards, you can also consider paying them off more than once per month — and even once per week. Not only can paying your credit card bills more than once per month help you avoid late payments, but it might also help you stay on track with your budget and spending goals.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Here's a good example of how this might work: Imagine you budget $750 per month for groceries and gas. If you only checked in on your credit card bill at the end of your billing period, it might be easy to spend more than you budgeted in these categories and others. </p>\n<p>If you checked in on your credit card bill weekly and made payments each time, on the other hand, you'd have a better idea of how much you're spending throughout the month and be in the best position to avoid an ugly end-of-the-month surprise. </p>\n<h3>Look for ways to automate your other bills</h3>\n<p>Also, remember that bills other than your credit card bills make up your payment history, and that your mortgage payment and car payment can also play a role. If you're able, setting up automatic payments for these bills can help you maintain a perfect payment history and avoid a ding on your credit score. </p>\n<p>If you have a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-cash-back-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">credit card that earns rewards</a>, setting up all your bills to be paid automatically with a credit card instead of by check or electronic funds transfer can boost your rewards haul each year as well. And provided you pay your balance in full each month, the rewards you earn can truly be \"free.\"</p>\n<h3>Institute a weekly financial check-up</h3>\n<p>Finally, it always makes sense to plan a weekly meeting with your checkbook, your bills, and anyone you share your finances with. This is especially true if you're trying to live on a budget or spending plan since you'll need to check in with your spending fairly regularly to see where you're at.</p>\n<p>To be more specific, it can be helpful to set aside some time every week to check and see which bills you have due, how much you've spent in regular categories, and how much of your budget is left for the month. Just remember that you're more likely to stick with it if you commit to a specific date and time for your meeting, such as Saturday mornings or Monday nights.</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Your payment history makes up the bulk of your FICO score, but it's also one area of your life where you have the utmost control. Any steps you can take to create a perfect payment history can only work to your advantage, so make sure to get started today. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Borrowing money to purchase a home that should rise in value over time is usually considered a smart move, for example. A business loan can also be a net positive provided the funds are used to help you become more profitable over the years.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, there are plenty of kinds of debt that just aren't worth it — especially if the amount you owe is more than you can handle or your interest rate is absurdly high.</p>\n<p>If your goal is building wealth and enjoying a life free of financial stress, your best bet is avoiding debts that make getting ahead harder than it has to be. Here are some of the worst offenders.</p>\n<h2>Student loans</h2>\n<p>Student loans can be a net positive for your life if you borrow as little as you can and parlay your degree into a profitable career. And since federal student loans tend to come with low fixed interest rates, student debt doesn't have to ruin your life. </p>\n<p>But what happens if you overpay for school — or if you borrow a ton of money but never graduate?</p>\n<p>Far too many students have found out the hard way just how unforgiving student debt can be. For starters, it's nearly impossible to discharge student loans in bankruptcy, so you're probably stuck with your student loans until you pay them off — no matter how long it takes.</p>\n<p>The high cost of higher education also means students are stuck borrowing more and more for a basic college degree. A report from College Board noted that, on a national level, even a public, four-year degree <a href=\"https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/average-published-undergraduate-charges-sector-2018-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cost students an average of $21,370</a> per year for the 2018-19 school year when you add in room and board. That means it costs nearly six figures to earn a Bachelor's degree — and that's if you choose an in-state, public school. </p>\n<p>If you find yourself struggling with <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-unique-ways-millennials-are-dealing-with-student-loan-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">student loan debt</a>, consider looking into alternative payment plans like income-driven plans or refinancing your student loans with a private lender. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/should-you-refinance-your-student-loan?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Should You Refinance Your Student Loans?</a>)</p>\n<h2>Credit card debt</h2>\n<p>Credit card debt is another wealth killer that can make it significantly harder to get ahead in life. Not only is credit card debt unsecured by any sort of asset, but the average credit card interest rate is now over 17%. That means that, no matter what you purchased on your credit card or how unnecessary it was, you could be paying out the nose to carry that debt from year to year.</p>\n<p>If you're struggling with credit card debt, the first thing you should do is <em>stop using credit cards</em>. Then create a plan to pay down debt, possibly using the <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-secrets-to-mastering-the-debt-snowball?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">debt snowball</a> or debt avalanche method. You can also use a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">balance transfer credit card</a> to secure 0% APR for a limited time, but this strategy only works if you have the discipline to quit using credit cards as a crutch.

But since they charge high fees and <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-payday-loan-en-1567/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interest rates as high as 400%</a>, these loans can trap you in a situation where you have to get one payday loan after another to pay your bills. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>When it comes to payday loans, the best step you can take is to avoid them altogether. If you're stuck with payday loan debt or in a payday loan cycle that's hard to break, on the other hand, you'll have to find a different strategy. </p>\n<p>Consider applying for a personal loan for bad credit that can help you pay off your payday loan and stay afloat until your next payday. Your interest rate may be high, but hopefully the pain will only be temporary.</p>\n<p>Also, look for ways to cut your spending or earn more money so you can pay off your high-interest loans and keep more of your income for yourself. Sell items you don't need online, pick up an <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-unexpected-side-benefits-of-your-side-hustle?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">easy side hustle</a>, or simply cut your bills for a few months, and you might buy enough time to get in a position where you no longer need payday loans just to get by. </p>\n<h2>Auto debt</h2>\n<p>According to the most recent report on the <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/content/dam/marketing/na/automotive/quarterly-webinars/credit-trends/q1-2019-safm-final-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of the Automotive Finance Market</a> from Experian, the average new car payment worked out to $554 during Q1 of 2019 for buyers with all types of credit. Worse, the average new car loan worked out to $32,187 with an average loan term of more than 68 months. </p>\n<p>Even if you need a car to get to work, there's just no excuse to borrow this much — or for so long. This is especially true if you're not saving enough money each month, you don't have an emergency fund, or your income isn't very high.</p>\n<p>Remember that cars can easily lose <a href=\"https://www.carfax.com/blog/car-depreciation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20% of their value</a> during the first year of ownership. After that, they can lose up to 10% of their initial value for the next four years, according to CarFax. Unfortunately, far too many Americans just trade their cars in at that point, starting the process over again with a huge new loan on a depreciating asset.</p>\n<p>You probably need a car to take care of your children and get to work, but you're better off if you borrow less and pay it off as fast as you can. Consider a used car with a much lower initial price, then choose a shorter repayment term so you can get out of debt faster. And once your car is paid off, keep it forever.

Smith made headlines in May of this year when he announced he would completely wipe out the student loan debt for every single member of the class of 2019. Nearly 400 graduates from Morehouse now find themselves debt-free as they begin their post-college lives, thanks to Mr. Smith's generosity.</p>\n<p>This can be a tough story to read if you're one of the millions of college students graduating with student loan debt. But even without a generous billionaire benefactor to erase your debt, you can feel in control of your student loans. Here's how you can start making your student loan payments, without feeling overwhelmed. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-unique-ways-millennials-are-dealing-with-student-loan-debt?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11 Unique Ways Millennials Are Dealing With Student Loan Debt</a>)</p>\n<h2>Know your full balance</h2>\n<p>Typically, borrowers take out student loans on an annual basis rather than in one fell swoop. That means you may have a number of loans, possibly from various lenders. This also makes it easy to ignore your full balance, since it requires some effort on your part to calculate the total.</p>\n<p>However, burying your head in the sand will only make repayment more difficult once your grace period ends. It's far better to be prepared when the bills start arriving. To calculate your full balance, make sure you track down each and every loan you took out. Start by checking your federal loan balances through the <a href=\"https://nslds.ed.gov/nslds/nslds_SA/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Student Loan Data System</a>. </p>\n<p>If you have any private loans, that can make your search a little more difficult, since there is no central database of such loans. If you're not sure of your private loan information, contact your alma mater for the names of your private lenders. From there, you can contact each lender for your total, and find out how long your grace period is and what you will owe per month.</p>\n<p>This is also a good time to reach out to all of your lenders with your most current contact information. Making sure they know how to reach you is the best way to stay on top of your repayment schedule. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-manage-student-loans-on-a-low-income?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Manage Student Loans On a Low Income</a>)</p>\n<h2>Use your grace period wisely</h2>\n<p>Most borrowers will have a six-month grace period after they graduate before they're required to begin making payments. Whether you're lucky enough to step right into a job or you're figuring out how to make ends meet with multiple side hustles, this grace period gives you an opportunity to figure out how to handle your finances as a newly-minted adult.</p>\n<p>Use this time to create and live within a budget. Consider setting aside the monthly amount of your student loan payment in a savings account. That will get you used to budgeting for your student loan payment and can give you a good <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-easy-ways-to-build-an-emergency-fund-from-0?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">start on an emergency fund</a>.</p>\n<h2>Plan for your last student loan payment</h2>\n<p>Before you make your first payment, take a look at the payment schedule and calendar to see where you'll be as of your last payment. What do you hope to have accomplished by then? Where do you want to be in your career? In your life?</p>\n<p>Doing this mental exercise can help motivate you to move up that last loan payment. Crunch the numbers to see what sending an additional $40 per month will do to your payoff date. Keep that last payment in mind when you receive windfalls or raises, since it can bring you closer to the finish line. </p>\n<h2>Explore your repayment options</h2>\n<p>The standard repayment plan typically equals monthly payments for 10 years. This option works for the majority of borrowers and makes budgeting relatively simple.</p>\n<p>However, if you're graduating into tough job prospects or any other unusual circumstances, the 10-year repayment plan may not be your best option. If you have federal student loans, you can also choose a different <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">repayment plan</a> that may better fit with your current economic circumstances. Some of these options include:</p>\n<h3>Graduated repayment</h3>\n<p>With this plan, your payments are lower at first, and increase at regular intervals (usually every two years). This plan will still have you finish repayment within 10 years, but you'll pay more in interest over the life of the loan.</p>\n<h3>Extended repayment</h3>\n<p>If you owe more than $30,000, you can qualify for this fixed or graduated repayment plan which gives you up to 25 years to pay off your loans. As with the graduated repayment plan, you'll pay more in interest with an extended plan.</p>\n<h3>Pay As You Earn (PAYE)</h3>\n<p>The PAYE plan sets your monthly payment at 10 percent of your discretionary income, but caps your monthly payment at no more than you would have paid under the standard 10-year repayment. Your payments are recalculated each year, and you need to update your income and family size each year, even if they haven't changed. If you have an outstanding balance on your loan after 20 years of making on-time payments under this plan, the remaining balance will be forgiven. </p>\n<h3>Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)</h3>\n<p>This plan is similar to the PAYE plan, except there is no cap to your monthly payment amount. That means if your income increases to the point where 10 percent of your discretionary income is greater than your monthly payment amount under standard repayment, then you'll have to pay the higher amount. In addition, your outstanding balance is forgiven after 20 years for loans taken for undergraduate education. The balance will be forgiven after 25 years for loans you took for graduate school.</p>\n<h3>Income-based repayment</h3>\n<p>If you have a high level of debt compared to your income, you may be eligible for income-based repayment, where your monthly payment amount is set at 10 or 15 percent of your discretionary income. Your payments are recalculated each year, and your outstanding balance will be forgiven after 20 years of on-time payments.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Income-contingent repayment</h3>\n<p>With this plan, your monthly amount will be the lesser of 20 percent of discretionary income or the amount you would pay under a 12-year fixed repayment plan. Your payments are recalculated each year, and any outstanding balance after 25 years will be forgiven.</p>\n<h3>Income-sensitive repayment</h3>\n<p>Low-income borrowers who have Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans can qualify for this repayment plan. For this plan, your monthly payment is based on annual income, but your loan will be paid in full within 15 years.</p>\n<p>While private student loans generally do not offer as many repayment options compared to federal student loans, it's worth checking with your lenders to see what they can do for you if standard repayment will be a financial burden.</p>\n<h2>Learn about your forbearance and deferment rights</h2>\n<p>Federal student loan borrowers have a couple of other benefits that can help make repayment more doable, even in tough economic situations. </p>\n<p>Forbearance allows borrowers to pause their student loan payments for up to 12 months at a time. During that time, their interest accrues. You can either pay the interest as it accrues, or let it be added to your balance (which means it will compound during your forbearance). You are restricted to three instances (a cumulative limit of 36 months) of forbearance throughout the life of your loan.</p>\n<p>Deferment also allows borrowers to pause payments, although deferment is offered in six-month increments. This program is tougher to qualify for, because you are generally not responsible for paying the accrued interest during a deferment.</p>\n<p>Both of these options should be kept in your back pocket for real financial pickles, such as unemployment, illness or disability, or new parenthood.</p>\n<h2>Research consolidation and refinancing</h2>\n<p>You can also potentially reduce your monthly student loan payment through consolidation or refinancing. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, they are different beasts. </p>\n<p>Federal <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/what-s-the-difference-between-student-loan-refinancing-and-consolidation?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">student loan consolidation</a> allows you to consolidate multiple federal student loans into a single loan with one repayment schedule. There is no option for consolidation with private loans, unfortunately. Consolidating your federal student loans can potentially lower your monthly payment (although that will often extend your payoff date). Most likely, you won't save money on interest, since you're charged the weighted average interest rate of the combined loans. And consolidation can help you switch from a variable to a fixed interest rate, which may lower your overall loan costs.</p>\n<p>Refinancing is similar to consolidation in that it puts all of your loans in a single basket. But with refinancing, you're applying for a single private loan that will pay off your various loans, and you will adhere to the requirements of your new loan from that point forward.</p>\n<p>The benefit of refinancing is that you can put both federal and private loans under your new loan, and you may be able to improve your interest rate or other terms. The downside is that if you refinance a federal loan, you lose access to all the federal benefits, including the various repayment options and access to deferment and forbearance.</p>\n<h2>The debt-payoff marathon</h2>\n<p>While the 2019 graduates of Morehouse College may have received a head start, all student loan borrowers can reach the day when their debt is in the rear-view mirror. </p>\n<p>For those of us without a fairy god-billionaire, eliminating student debt is a matter of knowing your loans, your rights, your options, and your budget. A little preparation now will save you a lot of wasted energy and stress during your debt-payoff marathon.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

That was the very day that Hurricane Agnes — the costliest tropical storm to hit the United States in recorded history at the time — made landfall.</p>\n<p>Mom and Dad woke up on the morning of their nuptials to the news that most of their guests were unable to attend the wedding due to the flooding in Baltimore. They tried to reduce the wasted food and drinks at their reception by inviting anyone and everyone able to brave the streets, including my grandmother's hairdresser and the neighbors of several guests.</p>\n<p>Nobody expects a national emergency-inducing hurricane on their wedding day, least of all in Baltimore in June. Of course, insurance was created specifically to protect you from the unexpected. Wedding insurance may not have existed when my parents got married, but could it be a way for couples nowadays to protect themselves (and their deposits!) from an expensive wedding emergency?</p>\n<p>Here's what you need to know about whether wedding insurance is the right way for you to make sure your wedding goes off without a hitch. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/15-surprising-insurance-policies-you-might-need?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15 Surprising Insurance Policies You Might Need</a>)</p>\n<h2>What is wedding insurance?</h2>\n<p>Wedding insurance, which is also billed as special event insurance, is an insurance policy that covers cancellation of a major event due to adverse weather or the death, illness, or serious injury of a key participant. In addition to the cancellation coverage, marrying couples can also purchase riders for their wedding insurance that cover things like military deployment, protection of bridal wear from damage or vendor bankruptcy, theft or damage to wedding gifts, and personal liability for injury or damage.</p>\n<p>The ability to protect yourself financially in case of a wedding catastrophe may make wedding insurance sound like a slam dunk, but it's often unnecessary, according to Lindsay Rocamora, a wedding and event planner based in Wisconsin. </p>\n<p>Instead, she recommends taking a hard look at the possible problems you might encounter on your big day.</p>\n<h2>What might happen on your wedding way?</h2>\n<p>While no one wants to think about how things could go wrong on their wedding day, Rocamora recommends that all couples think through the moving parts that could cause a problem.</p>\n<h3>The little disasters</h3>\n<p>The things most likely to go wrong are also things you can ask about before signing a contract. </p>\n<p>Rocamora recommends asking questions like: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What happens if the photographer or DJ gets sick? <br>\n     </li>\n<li>What is the backup plan if the caterer drops the cake? <br>\n     </li>\n<li>Is the company insured? <br>\n     </li>\n<li>What are the penalties if the company fails to deliver on the promised goods or services? <br>\n     </li>\n<li>What happens if you need to cancel the contract? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding the clauses in your contracts with vendors can help you understand what your options will be in case of a problem. Rocamora also points out that wedding insurance doesn't necessarily cover these kinds of problems.</p>\n<h3>Fire, flood, or act of God</h3>\n<p>Many couples assume that purchasing wedding insurance will take care of them in case of a major weather event or other forces outside of their control. Unfortunately, that's not necessarily the case. </p>\n<p>While cancellation or postponement coverage on a wedding policy could pay out in the event of an extreme weather phenomenon, it's generally only honored in the case of a statewide emergency. A more localized weather emergency may just be considered bad luck for the happy couple.</p>\n<p>Rocamora also warns that many vendors indemnify themselves in their contracts in case of bad weather or another type of emergency: </p>\n<p>\"Most venues and vendors have a Force Majeure clause that protects them in the event of an act of God,\" Rocamora reports. \"I've heard of tornadoes destroying venues, or fires at bakeries. If there is a drought in Argentina, then flowers will become scarce or more expensive. But the Force Majeure gives couples no recourse if this happens.\"</p>\n<p>Wedding insurance generally doesn't protect couples from such bad luck, especially if their vendors have a Force Majeure clause.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Vendor bankruptcy</h3>\n<p>In 2017, bridal retailer <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/bridal-retailer-alfred-angelo-files-chapter-7-abruptly-shutters/447217/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alfred Angelo abruptly declared bankruptcy</a> and immediately shuttered all of its stores worldwide, which meant customers showed up to pick up their dresses and accessories, only to find the doors locked.</p>\n<p>This situation was heartburn-inducing for the brides who were simply out of luck, although Angelo's biggest competitor David's Bridal (which carried many of the same designs) offered affected customers big discounts to help them keep their wedding plans on track.</p>\n<p>According to Rocamora, wedding insurance could potentially help with such a problem, which may also occur with small, local vendors. The Angelo bankruptcy was a huge problem in the wedding industry with ripples throughout the United States and globally, but local vendors can also find themselves on shaky financial ground.</p>\n<h3>Liability coverage</h3>\n<p>Having a number of drunk wedding guests all in one place can potentially lead to damage, destruction, injury, or half the family refusing to speak to the other half. This is where wedding insurance could be helpful in protecting yourself from liability.</p>\n<p>\"Certainly most of my terrible wedding stories begin with vodka,\" Rocamora states. \"But Wisconsin at least has some very strict liquor laws for venues and parks.\" Even if you don't live in Wisconsin, most state laws will require your venue to carry the coverage necessary to protect you in case a drunken reveler causes injury or damage. </p>\n<p>Of course, if you're getting married in your backyard, then your venue does not already have the necessary coverage. But an umbrella policy with <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-times-to-update-your-homeowners-insurance?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your homeowners insurance</a> will likely take care of your needs, and potentially for less than a wedding insurance policy.</p>\n<p>Don't forget that you may be held liable for any guests who drive drunk after your wedding. That means you should be sure you have the full coverage you need. Consider offering shuttles to a hotel or providing places to sleep it off, since a guest driving drunk is more than just financially devastating.</p>\n<h3>Lost or destroyed gifts</h3>\n<p>Another big selling point for wedding insurance is protection from stolen, lost, or destroyed wedding gifts. However, if gifts are stolen or damaged while at your home or in your car, then your homeowners insurance or auto insurance policy may already cover the loss.</p>\n<p>Similarly, your venue may have coverage that will take care of you in the event that your gifts are stolen. Ask your venue and check with your current insurance policies before spending money on a special event policy, since it may not be needed.</p>\n<h2>Protecting your wedding day</h2>\n<p>The best-laid plans of brides and grooms oft go awry, and anyone who has ever been to a wedding can attest to the impossibility of a major event coming together perfectly. But there's a difference between the funny story of the caterer delivering a bachelorette cake to the wedding, and a true wedding day disaster.</p>\n<p>To protect your wedding day, Rocamora recommends doing your research, asking lots of questions before signing contracts, using reputable vendors, and checking your homeowners insurance coverage, rather than wedding insurance.

You may need to borrow money to pay for a major home repair, your kid's braces, or a new car to get to work, for example. Personal loans are also popular for debt consolidation since they tend to offer much lower interest rates than credit cards.</p>\n<p>One big benefit of personal loans is that they're <em>very</em> predictable and easy to plan for. Unlike credit cards that offer variable interest rates that can change over time, personal loans come with fixed interest rates, fixed repayment periods, and fixed monthly payments that always stay the same. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-times-personal-loans-may-be-better-than-credit-cards?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Times Personal Loans May Be Better Than Credit Cards</a>)</p>\n<p>Another benefit of personal loans is the fact they often come without any fees. Of course, these personal loans are typically only available to consumers with good, very good, or exceptional credit, or FICO scores over 670. And actually, those with the very best credit — FICO scores over 740 — are the ones most likely to qualify for the best rates and terms, according to myFICO.</p>\n<p>With good or great credit, you should be able to qualify for a personal loan that doesn't tack on fees that make it more expensive over time. Here are the fees you should try to avoid. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-fees-you-need-to-stop-paying-right-now?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8 Fees You Need to Stop Paying Right Now</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Application fees</h2>\n<p>Most personal lenders don't charge a fee to apply for their products, but some do. These fees are assessed in order to cover the costs of processing your application and setting up your new loan, and they're non-refundable.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you should look for lenders who don't charge any application fees to apply. Even better, look for lenders that let you get pre-qualified without a hard inquiry on your credit report. That way, you can gauge your ability to qualify without any negative impact to your credit score.</p>\n<h2>2. Origination fees</h2>\n<p>Outside of application fees, many reputable lenders charge origination fees — or fees assessed to originate your loan. These fees can vary by lender and even with the same lender depending on your credit score and other factors. They can even be as high as 8 percent of your loan amount, which is a lot. As an example, peer-to-peer lender Lending Club states they charge origination fees that depend on a consumer's credit rating and the information in their application, <a href=\"https://help.lendingclub.com/hc/en-us/articles/216117807-What-fees-do-borrowers-pay-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranging from 1 to 6 percent</a> of the loan amount.</p>\n<p>The good news is that many lenders don't charge these fees. If your credit is good enough to qualify for a lender that doesn't charge an origination fee, you should opt out of this fee altogether.</p>\n<h2>3. Prepayment fees</h2>\n<p>Prepayment penalties are fees assessed on borrowers who pay their loans off early. No matter what, you should look for a personal loan that won't charge you extra fees for prepaying your loan. These fees are a waste of money, and they penalize you for doing the right thing.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>No matter how your credit rating looks, never sign up for a personal loan that charges you money for paying more than you have to.</p>\n<h2>4. Late fees</h2>\n<p>Most lenders charge late fees if you pay your personal loan later than your payment due date — or beyond any grace period they afford you. These fees are typically around $40 a pop, but you can rack up considerable fees if you're constantly paying your bill late.</p>\n<p>No matter which lender you sign up with, it helps to have a plan to make your monthly payment early or on time each month. Mark your due date in your calendar, set up alerts on your phone, or set your bill to be paid on auto-pay if you think it would help. Some loan companies even offer discounts when you set your loan payment to be paid automatically, so you could save money and avoid late payments in one fell swoop.</p>\n<h2>5. Returned check fees</h2>\n<p>Most lenders charge a fee for check processing if your check has to be returned for any reason, including insufficient funds. These fees can vary depending on the lender, but they are often around $15-$25 per returned check.</p>\n<p>You can avoid returned checks by making sure you always have the funds in the bank to cover your personal loan payment. Better yet, pay your personal loan payment online via direct transfer from your bank account. That way, your payment is posted much faster and you won't risk it getting lost in the mail.</p>\n<h2>How to shop for a personal loan</h2>\n<p>Now that you know which fees to avoid, you're probably wondering how you can find out which lenders charge fees and which don't. Your best bet is taking some time to shop around and compare lenders based on their interest rates, fees, and other factors. The <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/best-lenders-for-personal-loans?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best lenders for personal loans</a> offer loans with no fees, and they often let you get pre-qualified for a loan without filling out a full application or having a hard inquiry placed on your credit report.

While some cards dole out points good for statement credits or gift cards, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel credit cards</a> offer a different promise — the prospect of seeing the world at prices you can afford.</p>\n<p>No matter what type of rewards you're after, however, there's one thing that's certain — the more points you rack up, the more freebies you'll score.</p>\n<p>That's why credit card shopping portals are so important. They allow you to earn <em>more</em> points or miles for every dollar you spend, and with almost no effort on your part.

For the most part, they're online hubs that let you earn rewards with participating stores.</p>\n<p>Some credit card shopping portals are part of frequent flyer programs — American AAdvantage eShopping, Delta SkyMiles Shopping, and Southwest Rapid Rewards Shopping, for example. Others let you earn points or miles within specific credit card rewards programs.</p>\n<p>No matter which portal you use, they work pretty much the same. Each portal requires you to log into your account any time you shop online, but earning points is as easy as \"clicking through\" the portal to shop at any participating store. You'll normally find popular retailers like Macy's, Home Depot, Walmart, Staples, and Best Buy.</p>\n<p>Most stores that participate in shopping portals offer an extra one or two points or miles for each dollar you spend, and these miles will be automatically applied to your account shortly after an eligible purchase is made.

Here's exactly how you can get the most out of online shopping portals this year:</p>\n<h3>1. Double dip with a rewards credit card</h3>\n<p>The most important detail to keep in mind with shopping portals is that the points you earn are <em>on top of</em> rewards you earn with a rewards credit card. This means you can effectively \"double dip,\" earning rewards not only through portal spending, but based on the card you pay with. Also, remember that you don't always have to pay for your purchase with a credit card that corresponds with the portal you're using.</p>\n<h3>2. Use the right rewards credit card</h3>\n<p>Of course, you should focus on using the right credit card if you hope to score more points and miles over time. Sometimes, the stars align and make it easy to earn a ton of points in a hurry.</p>\n<p>For example, look for cards that might offer bonus categories that correspond with shopping portal purchases. If you have a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-cash-back-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cash back credit card</a> that offers 5 percent back on up to $1,500 spent in categories that rotate each quarter, and the current bonus category is home improvement stores, it would make sense to use that credit card if you planned to click through a portal to earn bonus points at Home Depot, right?</p>\n<p>The same is true whenever you have a credit card that offers more points for online purchases. Always assess your selection of credit cards to find the one that gives you the most points and miles for your purchase.</p>\n<h3>3. Keep your eye out for promotions</h3>\n<p>Also note that some credit card portals offer specific promotions from time to time, although this is mostly the case with airline shopping portals. United MileagePlus Shopping, American AAdvantage eShopping, and Alaska Mileage Plan Shopping frequently roll out promotions that let you earn additional points and miles if you meet a minimum spending requirement through their portals. While these deals can vary, they usually involve something like, \"spend $200 in cumulative purchases through the portal and earn 500 bonus miles.\"</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>If you discover a promotion that coincides with a purchase that needs to be made, you can \"triple dip\" by earning regular portal rewards, promotional rewards, and points or miles with your rewards credit card.</p>\n<h3>4. Compare earnings on different portals</h3>\n<p>Before you click through an airline shopping portal, it's important to compare the various ones you use. While one might be offering one additional point for each dollar you spend, another might offer three points per $1 at the very same store.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you use all the shopping portals that work with rewards programs you belong to. That way, you can take a few minutes to compare portal earnings before you shop.</p>\n<h3>5. Book \"services\" for even more rewards</h3>\n<p>Don't forget that shopping portals can work for other purchases you make online outside of regular shopping. You can also earn more points and miles booking specific services through portals, although the promotions change all the time.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind these kind of bonus offers change frequently, so you must check in with the portals you use before you pay for any service or book anything online. You may never find bonus points for a service at a time you actually need it, but you'll never know unless you look.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Many rewards cards even offer <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-sign-up-bonuses-for-airline-miles-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signup bonuses worth $500</a> or more right out of the gate, and that's <em>in addition to</em> the rewards you earn when you shop or pay bills.</p>\n<p>The problem? Not everyone can <em>or should</em> pursue rewards, for several reasons. In some cases, trying to earn rewards can even wreck your finances, damage your credit score, or both.</p>\n<p>Before you sign up for a cash back credit card or travel credit card, it's crucial to know the many ways pursuing points and miles can hurt you.</p>\n<h2>1. Going into debt by chasing rewards</h2>\n<p>A recent analysis of credit card data from the Federal Reserve from Experian revealed that only <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/survey-findings-how-do-consumers-feel-about-credit-cards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">45 percent of Americans</a> with credit cards are paying their balances in full each month. This means the other 55 percent carry a balance at least part of the time, and it's easy to assume <em>at least some</em> of those people are pursuing rewards, right?</p>\n<p>Because the average credit card now comes with an APR over 17 percent, this is a real problem. It makes almost no sense to try to earn 1 to 3 percent back while also paying over 17 percent in interest. The math just isn't there.</p>\n<p>If you're charging purchases you can't afford to pay off each month just for the rewards, credit card rewards are not for you. You'll be much better off using cash or debit instead since those options won't leave you grappling with high-interest debt. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-5-biggest-dangers-of-credit-card-debt?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 5 Biggest Dangers of Credit Card Debt</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Overspending to earn a signup bonus</h2>\n<p>Most cash back and travel rewards credit cards offer initial welcome bonuses to entice you to sign up. Many times, these bonuses are worth $500 or more in points or miles, and all you are required to do is meet a minimum spending requirement (e.g. spend $3,000 within three months of opening the account to earn 50,000 bonus points).</p>\n<p>While these offers are tempting, they can be problematic if you need to spend more than you normally would to meet the threshold. If your normal spending and bills don't add up to the minimum spending requirement within the allotted amount of time, what are you going to do?</p>\n<p>Way too many people use minimum spending requirements as an excuse to splurge for new furniture or plan a vacation. Unfortunately, this means the rewards they earn won't leave them ahead financially. They may wind up with new stuff or a trip to look forward to, but they also wind up with less money than when they started. There's nothing rewarding about that. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-smart-ways-to-meet-a-rewards-card-minimum-spending-requirement?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Smart Ways to Meet a Rewards Card Minimum Spending Requirement</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Unplanned travel spending</h2>\n<p>Another pitfall of travel rewards points is the simple fact you often have to spend money to redeem them. Let's say you sign up for a hotel or <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel credit card</a> that offers a free night certificate and initial rush of bonus points and you decide to cash them in for a week in Hawaii. All of a sudden, you're splurging for pricey flights, a week-long car rental, and food and fun for seven days. Sure, your hotel may have been free, but what was the total cost? (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-travel-rewards-credit-cards-really-work?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Travel Rewards Credit Cards Really Work</a>)</p>\n<p>Also, redeeming travel rewards can come with costs you may not anticipate outside of regular travel expenses. Cashing in airline miles for international flights can require you to pay several hundred dollars in airline taxes and fees, and some airlines tack on hundreds in fuel surcharges to boot.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Higher end hotels you redeem points with may also have unavoidable fees for valet parking or resort privileges. These expenses can and do add up over time, so don't forget to factor them in.</p>\n<h2>4. Too many annual fees</h2>\n<p>And what about the annual fees many of the top rewards and travel credit cards charge? Top travel credit cards charge annual fees of $450 or more, which is a lot of money no matter how you cut it.</p>\n<p>While annual fees can be worth it if you earn a lot of rewards and use travel benefits and perks regularly, they still add up. Before you sign up for too many credit cards with annual fees, make sure you have a plan to get <em>more value</em> than you're paying for. If you can't do that, then it's probably not worth it.</p>\n<h2>5. Damage to your credit score</h2>\n<p>Don't forget that the way you use credit cards can negatively impact your credit score. For example, opening new credit cards means having another hard inquiry on your credit report, which could cause your score to temporarily drop.</p>\n<p>Since your payment history makes up <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-5-things-with-the-biggest-impact-on-your-credit-score?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">35 percent of your FICO score</a>, falling behind on your credit card bills can also create a big problem. With your credit utilization — how much you owe in relation to your credit limits — making up another 30 percent of your FICO score, carrying large balances can hurt your score as well.</p>\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n<p>Credit cards that dole out points and miles can help you score free travel, earn cash back, or get other freebies, but that doesn't mean they're destined to leave you better off. Ultimately, the way you use your credit cards will determine whether they're a net positive for your finances.</p>\n<p>Before you sign up for a rewards credit card, it can help to have a basic game plan in place. Figure out how you can earn a big signup bonus without making unplanned purchases, and make sure you have the discipline to pay your balance in full each month. From there, make sure you're only paying annual fees on cards that are worth it.</p>\n<p>If that sounds like too much work, then it probably is.

Not only can travel insurance reimburse you if your trip is interrupted or canceled for reasons outside your control, but it can cover pricey medical bills, pay for medical evacuation in the event of an emergency, replace lost luggage, and more.</p>\n<p>But there are so many different types of travel insurance policies — and so many travel insurance providers — that finding the right policy isn't always easy. You have to choose a company you trust first and foremost, but you also need to find a policy that makes sense for your trip and your budget.</p>\n<p>Sa El, CEO of Simply Insurance says it's important to make sure your travel insurance provider has a strong reputation, an easy claims process, and proof that they pay claims reliably.</p>\n<p>\"This might seem like the last thing you should look for,\" he said. \"But there is nothing worse than attempting to file a claim and the insurance company is giving you the runaround.\"</p>\n<h2>What to look for in a policy</h2>\n<p>However, travel insurance policies aren't necessarily created equal. In addition to buying insurance from a reputable company, you need to pick a policy that includes the <em>types </em>of coverage you need for your specific trip. Here's what you need to know:</p>\n<h3>Make sure your policy includes trip cancellation/interruption insurance</h3>\n<p>Carol Mueller, Vice President of Strategic Marketing at Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection, says that the most common travel insurance claim in the U.S. is trip cancellation or \"reimbursement for your trip investment if you must cancel for a covered reason.\" This type of coverage comes into play when you have a trip booked and paid for but can't go due to health problems, civil unrest in your destination, or any other reasons your policy agrees to cover.</p>\n<p>\"It's important for travelers to purchase a policy with trip cancellation and interruption coverage if they want their trip deposits covered,\" she said. Without this type of coverage, you could lose any deposits you've made on your trip or any other amounts you paid upfront.</p>\n<p>While many hotels let you cancel up to 24 hours before your stay without a penalty, remember this isn't the case with airlines at all. Plus, there may be other components of your trip paid upfront including cruises, train travel, park tickets, group tours, and more. Trip cancellation/interruption insurance can reimburse you for all qualified reasons when you are unable to travel. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-times-travel-insurance-is-worth-it?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Times Travel Insurance Is Worth It</a>)</p>\n<h3>Pay extra for medical expense and medical evacuation coverage</h3>\n<p>Also, if traveling outside the U.S., Mueller says you should make sure your plan also includes coverage and adequate limits of emergency medical expenses and medical evacuation coverage. \"A comprehensive plan like Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection's ExactCare Extra will include those coverages and more,\" she said.</p>\n<p>With this specific policy, you get up to $50,000 in qualifying medical expenses reimbursed and up to $500,000 in emergency evacuation and repatriation of remains coverage. That might sound like a lot, but imagine how much it might cost if you broke your legs while hiking in a foreign country and had to be evacuated by helicopter. Or, just think of how much it would cost to have a heart attack abroad and fly home overseas with around-the-clock medical care.</p>\n<p>The bottom line: Paying extra for this type of coverage will be well worth it if you ever need it, and some policies include it already.</p>\n<h3>Some policies also offer fixed reimbursements</h3>\n<p>Mueller also notes that some policies have fixed benefits that pay out in a set amount any time a qualified event happens during your trip. With their ExactCare Extra plan, for example, you get a payout each time you miss a connection and get rerouted to your destination.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>\"While the airline is rebooking you on a later flight, ExactCare Extra automatically pays out $100 directly to you for simply enduring the glitch on your vacation,\" she said.</p>\n<h2>Benefits you may not need</h2>\n<p>While it's smart to pick a travel insurance policy that is as comprehensive as possible, Sa El said that you may not want to pay extra for optional benefits like Accidental Death Insurance or excessive amounts of coverage for your personal items.</p>\n<p>\"This is mainly because there are probably other policies such as your life insurance, renter's insurance, or home insurance plans that will cover you for those items,\" he said.</p>\n<p>You may also want to explore any travel insurance benefits you receive from a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel credit card</a>. Consumers with a travel card may already qualify for trip cancellation and interruption coverage, primary auto rental coverage, baggage delay insurance, trip delay insurance, lost luggage reimbursement, travel and emergency assistance, and travel accident insurance, among other perks.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind though that <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-types-of-travel-insurance-credit-cards-include-that-you-didnt-know-about?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rewards credit cards offering travel insurance</a> tend to be extremely light on medical coverage — if they offer any at all. Because medical bills can get out of control in a hurry, that can be a problem. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/when-is-your-credit-cards-travel-insurance-good-enough?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When Is Your Credit Card's Travel Insurance Good Enough?</a>)</p>\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n<p>Before you take your next trip anywhere — especially far from home — make sure you have a travel insurance policy in place. You may believe you can't afford to pay extra for this coverage, but the reality is, you may not be able to afford not to.</p>\n<p>Losing thousands of dollars in trip deposits or flights is bad enough, but racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills and emergency evacuation expenses could ruin your finances for years to come. With an affordable travel insurance policy in place, you can stop worrying about the \"what ifs\" and enjoy your trip.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Doing so allows you to earn miles on your regular spending, plus you can usually earn a signup bonus worth a few free flights. Other ways to earn miles include: signing up for frequent flyer programs, consistently flying with your favorite airline, using airline and travel rewards shopping portals, and keeping your eye out for special promotions.</p>\n<p>Amazingly though, there's one more way to earn miles — and it may just be the easiest. With airline dining rewards programs, you can earn miles for each dollar you spend when you dine at your favorite restaurants.</p>\n<h2>How do airline dining rewards programs work?</h2>\n<p>The concept of earning miles with dining programs is simple, although the rules that govern each independent dining rewards program can vary. Popular dining rewards programs include <a href=\"https://www.rapidrewardsdining.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining</a>, <a href=\"https://skymilesdining.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Delta SkyMiles Dining</a>, <a href=\"https://dining.mileageplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United MileagePlus Dining</a>, and <a href=\"https://aa.rewardsnetwork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Airlines Dining</a>, although other airlines run programs as well.</p>\n<p>Each airline dining program works with participating restaurants nationwide, making it easy to find establishments in your area or when you travel. Once you sign up for a dining rewards account, all that's required is using a credit or debit card tied to your account when you dine at a participating restaurant. Once you do, the miles you earn will be credited to your account — usually in less than 60 days.</p>\n<h2>How to earn the most miles</h2>\n<p>The number of miles you can earn depends on the program you decide to join, as well as other factors, but you should earn a minimum of one mile for each dollar you spend at a participating restaurant, and maybe more.</p>\n<h3>Earn more miles with elite dining status</h3>\n<p>Some dining rewards programs let you earn more miles each time you dine out once you reach a certain threshold within the program. With Delta SkyMiles Dining, for example, you can become a \"VIP Member\" after dining 11 times or more within the program by the end of the year. With a VIP membership, you'll earn five miles per dollar you spend at participating restaurants within the program.</p>\n<h3>Earn more miles for opting into emails</h3>\n<p>Southwest Rapid Rewards dining lets you earn three miles per $1 spent (as opposed to one mile per $2 spent) for dining members that agree to receive Rapid Rewards Dining emails. You can also earn more miles by opting into emails with the American AAdvantage Dining program or United MileagePlus Dining program and becoming a Select or VIP member.</p>\n<h3>Some dining programs offer a signup bonus</h3>\n<p>Airline dining programs incentivize consumers to sign up by offering initial signup bonuses worth a few thousand miles. With Delta SkyMiles Dining, for example, you'll earn 3,000 bonus miles for signing up and spending at least $30 (including tax and tip) at participating restaurants within the first 30 days of membership. American AAdvantage, United MileagePlus, and Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining offer similar bonuses.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Double dip with an airline or travel credit card</h3>\n<p>The best part about airline dining programs is that you can earn even more rewards by using a travel or <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-co-branded-airline-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">airline credit card</a> when you pay your restaurant bill. Remember that dining rewards are doled out <em>on top of</em> any points or miles you earn with a rewards credit card.</p>\n<h3>Connect multiple cards to each account</h3>\n<p>Most airline dining programs let you connect multiple credit and debit cards to your account, so make sure to connect all cards you use frequently. By connecting all credit cards you're likely to use, you'll never miss out on miles when you dine out.</p>\n<h3>You can usually pay with any rewards card you want</h3>\n<p>With most dining programs, you can use any credit card you want to pay provided it's connected to your account. This means you don't have to use an American AAdvantage card when you're dining within American AAdvantage dining, for example. Instead, you can use a rewards card that gives you more miles or <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-credit-cards-for-dining-out?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cash back for dining out</a>.</p>\n<h3>Join more than one program — or all the programs</h3>\n<p>If you earn miles in more than one frequent flyer program, there's no reason you shouldn't join every dining rewards program available to you. Free miles are on the table — including signup bonuses — so maximize all of them to earn as much free travel as you can.

Joining these programs is free and you could benefit more than you think if your favorite restaurants participate in your area.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

The average credit card interest rate is currently over 17% APR, after all. That's a ton of money in interest to fork over for no real benefit, and the cost can be even more crushing if you need months or years to repay.</p>\n<p>For that reason — and really, for plenty of others — many <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/best-lenders-for-personal-loans?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consumers turn to personal loans</a> for their borrowing needs. Unlike credit cards with variable interest rates, personal loans come with a fixed interest rate that can be as low as 4.99% APR. Personal loans also come with a fixed repayment timeline and a fixed monthly payment that will never catch you by surprise. If you need to borrow a large sum of money and pay it back over 24, 48, 60 months, or longer, a personal loan can make the experience a lot less expensive and much more predictable.

You can overspend and send your finances into a tailspin with credit cards <em>or</em> a personal loan if you don't know your limits.</p>\n<p>Really, there are savvy ways to use a personal loan and disastrous ways that can leave you worse off in the end. Here are some ways to use a personal loan, and some to avoid at all costs. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/this-is-the-difference-between-a-loan-and-a-line-of-credit?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This Is the Difference Between a Loan and a Line of Credit</a>)</p>\n<h2>Smart ways to use a personal loan</h2>\n<p>If you're going to apply for a personal loan, make sure you use it the correct way.</p>\n<h3>Consolidating high-interest debt</h3>\n<p>If you have high-interest debt that's making it difficult to get ahead, consolidating with a personal loan can make a lot of sense. Imagine your credit cards have the average APR of 17% or higher and you're able to consolidate with a personal loan that boasts an APR of 5% or 6%. Not only will you save big money on interest payments, but you can simplify your life by going from multiple payments each month down to just one. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/which-balance-transfer-credit-card-is-the-best-for-you?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Which Balance Transfer Credit Card Is The Best For You?</a>)</p>\n<h3>Updating your home</h3>\n<p>A mid-range bathroom model cost $20,420 while a mid-range kitchen overhaul cost an average of $66,196, according to Remodeling Magazine's 2019 Cost vs. Value report. A personal loan lets you borrow a large lump sum of money for a home remodeling project and repay it slowly over time with a competitive APR.</p>\n<h3>Paying for pricey home repairs</h3>\n<p>Replacing a leaky roof with asphalt shingles cost an average of $22,636, but how would you come up with that money if you had to? Of course, there are other expensive components of a home that need to be replaced or fixed from time to time, including HVAC systems, plumbing, electrical, and more. An unsecured personal loan could provide you with the cash you need with a monthly payment you'd probably be able to afford.</p>\n<h3>Fixing your car</h3>\n<p>If the car you drive to work breaks down and needs thousands of dollars in repairs, a personal loan could help you finance the job so you can get back on the road.</p>\n<h3>Starting a business</h3>\n<p>Finally, a personal loan can be used if you need startup costs to buy supplies or invest in a new business. As your business grows and becomes profitable, you can repay your loan and reinvest your company's profits.</p>\n<h2>Disastrous ways to use a personal loan</h2>\n<p>Don't apply for a personal loan if you plan on using it the following ways.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Paying for a vacation you can't really afford</h3>\n<p>If you need to borrow money to go on vacation, you're can't afford to take one. That's a painful truth, but it's one many people refuse to acknowledge. Paying for a vacation with a personal loan may seem like a good idea, but you'll regret it once you're making payments on that trip for years to come.</p>\n<h3>Covering college tuition</h3>\n<p>Going to college is a smart way to invest in yourself, but you should use federal student loans before you use a personal loan. Not only do federal student loans come with affordable interest rates, but they grant you access to government benefits and protections including deferment, forbearance, and income-driven repayment plans.

If you lose your shirt (which you likely will!), you will still have to make payments on your personal loan until it's paid off. Never gamble unless you have the money to lose.</p>\n<h3>Investing</h3>\n<p>Gambling your personal loan funds is a bad idea, but so is using them to invest. You may <em>believe</em> you can earn more money investing than you pay in interest on your personal loan, but there are no guarantees when you invest your money — no matter how experienced you are. If you invest and take a big loss, you'll be out your personal loan funds <em>plus interest.</em></p>\n<h2>Should you get a personal loan?</h2>\n<p>Personal loans are easy to apply for, which makes them incredibly appealing but also dangerous. If you borrow for the wrong reasons and don't have a plan to pay the money back, you could wind up making a financial decision you'll live to regret.</p>\n<p>As a general rule of thumb, it only makes sense to borrow money when you have a clear purpose and a realistic plan to pay it back. If you borrow without any real goal in mind or the money to repay what you owe, you're setting yourself up for failure.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

For most, it's coming up with enough money for the down payment. The good news is that there are plenty of down payment assistance programs available to help buyers overcome this financial hurdle. Most of these programs are run by state or local governments, and they usually provide grants or forgivable loans for buyers who need help scraping together the <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/do-you-really-need-a-20-percent-down-payment-for-a-house?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thousands of dollars for a down payment</a>.</p>\n<p>There is a catch, though. These programs often come with strict requirements. Some, for instance, are only available to first-time homebuyers. Some aren't available to buyers who make too much money each year, and others require that buyers live in a home for up to five years after buying it. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-to-get-financially-fit-for-homebuying-season?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 Ways to Get Financially Fit for Homebuying Season</a>)</p>\n<h2>Down payments are expensive</h2>\n<p>It's no secret why down payments are such a burden for so many homebuyers — they're costly. Consider that a 5 percent down payment on a home costing $200,000 comes out to $10,000. That's a lot of money for buyers to scrape together, especially first-time buyers who don't already have a home to sell.</p>\n<p>If your FICO credit score is 580 or better, you can qualify for a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration, better known as an FHA loan, for a down payment of just 3.5 percent of your home's final purchase price. The Fannie Mae-guaranteed HomeReady program allows you to qualify for a mortgage with a down payment of just 3 percent. And if even that 3 percent down is too much of a financial struggle? That's where down payment assistance programs can come in.</p>\n<h2>How down payment assistance programs work</h2>\n<p>Down payment assistance programs can work in several ways. Some will provide you with funds at closing that you can use to pay for your down payment or closing costs. Others will provide you with an interest-free forgivable loan that you can use to cover the same costs.</p>\n<p>The Homebuyer Assistance Program run by the city of Chicago, for instance, provides buyers with a <a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/general/HomeBuyerAssistanceProgramFlyer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grant for up to 7 percent</a> of buyers' total loan amount, based on income. Buyers can use this grant to cover the down payment or closing costs.</p>\n<p>The Low Income Purchase Assistance Program from the city of Los Angeles is a bit more complicated. It <a href=\"https://hcidla.lacity.org/help-low-income-first-home-buyers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">provides a loan of up to $90,000</a> for down payment, closing, and acquisition costs. The loan is deferred, meaning that homeowners don't have to make any monthly payments on it. They only have to pay it back when they sell their home, pay off their mortgage loan, or transfer the title of their home. If none of this happens, they will have to pay back their loan in 30 years.</p>\n<p>The city of San Antonio's Homeownership Incentive Program <a href=\"https://www.sanantonio.gov/NHSD/Programs/DownPayment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">loans $1,000 to $12,000 at 0 percent interest</a> in the form of a no-payment second loan. Buyers can use this loan to cover down payments or closing costs. The city says that 75 percent of this loan will be forgiven over a 10-year period.</p>\n<p>So, yes, down payment assistance programs can help you get into a home. But remember, there are potential drawbacks that come with them.

Some have income requirements</h2>\n<p>Most down payment assistance programs are only available to residents whose incomes fall under certain levels. In Chicago, for instance, buyers can have an annual income that is no higher than $131,775.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>2. Most have residence restrictions</h2>\n<p>Other programs will only allow buyers to purchase homes in certain areas. The city of San Antonio's program, for instance, only allows buyers to purchase homes within city limits. The same is true in most other cities across the country.</p>\n<h2>3. You may need to take classes</h2>\n<p>Programs usually require that participants complete homebuyer education programs. In Los Angeles, for example, applicants must complete an eight-hour, in-person homebuyer education class given by an approved provider.</p>\n<h2>4. Be prepared to stay put</h2>\n<p>Many programs require that buyers live in the homes they purchase for a set number of years. In Houston, the city's Homebuyer Assistance Program requires that <a href=\"http://www.houstontx.gov/housing/hap.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buyers live in their new homes</a> for at least five years. If you sell your home before the set number of years, you'll have to pay back the assistance you received on a prorated basis.</p>\n<h2>5. You might have to be a first-time homebuyer</h2>\n<p>Many programs are only available to participants who meet the criteria of \"first-time\" buyer. There is some leeway here, though. You might be considered a first-time buyer even if you've owned a home before. Some programs define a first-time buyer as someone who has not owned a home in the last three to five years.</p>\n<h2>6. There might be home price limits</h2>\n<p>Many programs also limit the price of the new home you can buy. In San Antonio, for instance, you can only purchase an <a href=\"https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/0/Files/NHSD/DownPayment/SalesPriceLimits.pdf?ver=2018-04-20-103128-487\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">existing home costing up to $170,000</a>. New-construction homes can only cost $228,000.</p>\n<p>If you're struggling with down payment funds, consider assistance programs. Just remember that these programs do come with requirements that could limit the home you buy, where you buy, and how long you must live in that residence.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

One of the main reasons is that tourist hubs like Playa Del Carmen and Cancun have largely been protected from the worst of the unrest.</p>\n<p>Recently, this has started to change and there have been gruesome and shocking incidents occurring in areas once thought unaffected. A bomb recently detonated on a passenger ferry from Playa Del Carmen that injured over 20 people. Cancun has seen various incidents of gun violence, including multiple murders on its white sand beaches and even a gunman firing at the beach from a jet ski. Another popular tourist area, Los Cabos in Baja California, has also felt the effects after a spate of grisly murders over the past year.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that it does have a serious crime problem, with more than 29,000 murders in 2017, Mexico is still generally very safe for visitors. There are other amazing destinations throughout Mexico that have not been hit by the same problems, and would make an excellent choice for a vacation. Here are five destinations in Mexico that are safer than Playa Del Carmen and Cancun at the moment.

Guanajuato</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The picturesque city of Guanajuato, which lies right in the center of Mexico, is still famed for its silver production in particular. At one point during the 18th century, it was one of the biggest producers of silver in the world, which meant it was flooded with wealth. This is clearly visible in the colonial mansions and ornate churches that you'll come across when wandering the narrow streets, many of which are so tight that cars can't navigate them.</p>\n<p>The city meanders its way right up into the surrounding mountains, which are dotted with a mish mash of vibrantly colored buildings. Among them you'll discover museums, theaters, plazas surrounded by outdoor cafes, and various interesting marketplaces. The atmosphere in Guanajuato is laid back, making it the perfect relaxing city break with a cultural leaning.</p>\n<h2>2. San CristÃ³bal de las Casas</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tucked away in the mountains of Chiapas in southern Mexico, San CristÃ³bal is relatively cold due to the altitude, and far away from either coast, so you won't be getting any beach time. However, what San CristÃ³bal does have in abundance is character, culture, and colorful colonial architecture, which combined with its rich history, make it one of the most fascinating towns in the country.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>The local population here has a uniquely high proportion of indigenous people from two main groups, the Tzotzil and the Tzelta. In the center, pastel colored buildings with red tile roofs line narrow cobbled streets, making it a picturesque place to explore. The mix of traditional and modern provides an interesting dynamic, with lively markets and street sellers offering handmade crafts. Those sit alongside bustling contemporary bars, cafes, and restaurants.</p>\n<h2>3. Puerto Vallarta</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Puerto Vallarta is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Mexico and has a sizable expat population, thanks to its modern amenities, lovely beaches, and a lively night life. But despite the similarities it shares with the likes of Cancun and Playa Del Carmen, it's actually got a completely different feel to it. There are two faces to Puerto Vallarta, the old and the new, with one boasting vast resorts and visitor-oriented attractions, the other filled with cobbled streets and the feel of a long-established Puebla.</p>\n<p>A wide and busy boardwalk runs from the heart of the old \"Romantic Zone\" along the seafront out toward the newer part of the city. Along its edges you'll find restaurants, bars, and shops selling everything from craft tequilas to souvenirs usually found in popular beach towns.

Oaxaca City</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Oaxaca City is currently enjoying something of a moment, having been billed by those in the know as Mexico's culinary epicenter. Regional delicacies hailing from this part of the country include the complicated and rich mole sauce; Tlayudas, which has been likened to a Mexican version of pizza; and chapulines (aka grasshoppers), which are widely used in various dishes. But there's more to Oaxaca than top notch noshes.</p>\n<p>The entire historic center of Oaxaca city has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site thanks to the historic monuments found within its meticulously planned boundaries. Despite the historic buildings, it's a modern city with cool cafes, trendy bars, and boutique hotels belying their antiquated facades. There are colorful markets filled with locally crafted goods, smoky food halls serving up delicious treats, and numerous festivals throughout the year during which the city explodes into colorful parties.

Tulum</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>This laid-back former hippy haven on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula is actually in Quintana Roo, the same state where both Playa Del Carmen and Cancun are located. However, it couldn't be more different. It's a beach town that isn't actually located on the edge of the coast, and lies a couple of miles inland with a large, green national park separating the two.</p>\n<p>The wide beaches nearby are fringed with boutique hotels, spa retreats, and easy going restaurants, so you can comfortably spend the day without heading into town. There are also some extremely well-preserved Mayan ruins inside the national park that provide spectacular views of the sea. The town itself is centered around a single main road that’s populated by traditional restaurants and bars.</p>\n<p>A bit further out, there are also spectacular cenotes, natural sinkholes formed when limestone bedrock collapses, exposing the ground water beneath. They’re a little slice of Eden. Gran Cenote is the most impressive, with turtles and colorful fish surrounding you as you snorkel.

What about all those goals you wanted to achieve back in January? Since close to half of New Year's resolutions are abandoned after a month, there's a good chance you've forgotten yours by now.</p>\n<p>That's not to say your goals weren't grand. According to a YouGov poll, the top three resolutions in 2018 were to eat healthier, get more exercise, and save more money. Even though the year is half over, there's still plenty of time to check those boxes. Rather than store them away again until next January, let's harness the power of the summer and finish 2018 strong.

If you're serious about accomplishing your goals in the next three months, let's change tactics.</p>\n<h2>Break your goals into manageable chunks</h2>\n<p>The reason many of us lose focus is that our goals are very lofty. They're also not well defined. It can be hard to determine whether you've had success if your goal isn't quantifiable. And when we don't see instant results, our motivation can wane. Instead of focusing on that grand goal of weight loss or debt reduction, start with a smaller interim step.</p>\n<p>Set a specific goal to exercise three times this week or drink two extra glasses of water every day. Now your goal is measurable and a feeling of accomplishment can be achieved, in short order. As time goes on and you achieve the smaller goals, you're likely to sustain the adjusted healthy behavior.</p>\n<p>If you have a mountain of debt ahead of you, focus on <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-minute-finance-track-your-spending?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">tracking expenses</a> to see where your money is going, and getting a written budget in place before each pay period. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-steps-to-successful-budgeting?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Steps to Successful Budgeting</a>)</p>\n<p>These smaller tasks are manageable and easy to repeat regularly, but don't get ahead of yourself. Build up momentum during the days of summer so that you can turn this newfound focus into a positive long-term habit way before Christmas rolls around.

Whether that's an exercise partner, someone with the authority to pinch you anytime you reach for a cigarette, or a <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/want-to-win-at-personal-finance-start-a-money-club?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">money club</a> who meets regularly to discuss financial goals and priorities. We are not designed to live this life alone. So recruiting someone who can participate in your journey to goal completion can make all the difference.</p>\n<p>Opening up to someone about things we feel less confident about can be scary. It's hard to be vulnerable and let others in on the big secret that we don't have it all together. The good news is that people in your life already know you have flaws. We all do. Exchange support with your friends and family members because they might need help dusting off and resurrecting their New Year's resolutions, too.

Every single day.</p>\n<p>That's what former Navy SEAL, four-star admiral, and former chancellor at the University of Texas — William H. McRaven — attributes to his success. He told USA Today, \"There's a power behind making your bed every morning. Learn to do the little things well, learn to make your bed right. And that transcends into a lot of other things you do.\"</p>\n<p>His book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JY7l2e\" target=\"_blank\">Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life ... And Maybe the World</a>, discusses his theory of how starting your day off by accomplishing a doable task, like making your bed, sets the tone for the rest of your day. When you have a sense of accomplishment early on, you create a sense of momentum that will build and help you tackle more complex tasks with gusto.</p>\n<p>So give it a try. For the next three months, start your day by making your bed. See if that doesn't translate into significant progress toward completing those resolutions by Labor Day.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

That meant Dad had some very strong opinions about insurance in general, and life insurance in particular. He was not shy about sharing those opinions with a captive audience — aka, his daughter.</p>\n<p>Even though I heard Dad opine (and rant!) on any number of finance-related subjects, the viewpoint that stuck with me most was Dad's stance on life insurance for children.</p>\n<p>\"There is no reason whatsoever to ever buy such a product,\" he told me on more than one occasion. \"Life insurance is for income replacement. Policies for children are morbid.\"</p>\n<p>While part of Dad's objection to life insurance for kids stemmed from the exploitative practices you can find among disreputable insurance salespeople, he was also quick to admit that his own superstitions about tempting your children's fate added to his distaste for the products.</p>\n<p>Though dear old Dad was right more often than not, I have come to see much more value in children's life insurance than he did. Here are some compelling things to consider before purchasing life insurance for your child. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/term-vs-whole-life-insurance-heres-how-to-choose?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Term vs Whole Life Insurance: Here's How to Choose</a>)</p>\n<h2>Funeral expenses</h2>\n<p>The average funeral in America costs about $10,000. Financial experts (including my father) might say that parents needing to pay such expenses for a child should use their savings to do so. But considering the fact that half of all Americans couldn't come up with $400 in an emergency, the expert opinion may not match most people's financial reality.</p>\n<p>My dad did have an answer to this objection, however. There are many funeral homes that will offer their services free of charge for families who cannot afford the burial costs of losing a child.</p>\n<p>That means parents who are considering life insurance for their children just because of the potential cost of final expenses might not actually need a policy. Not only is it unlikely that you will ever need the insurance payout, since it's relatively rare for children to die, but you will likely be able to find financial help or free-of-cost services if the worst should happen.</p>\n<h2>Income replacement</h2>\n<p>Dad made it clear that he believed life insurance was for income replacement only. So unless you're raising a child star, there is no reason to purchase a policy for your kid. (And you didn't want to get Dad started on parents who pushed their kids into show business.)</p>\n<p>However, Dad's view didn't consider <em>whose</em> income will need to be replaced after the death of a child. The majority of children do not have an income, of course — but it's important to remember the very real cost of grief. Heartbroken parents may find themselves paralyzed by their grief and unable to work.</p>\n<p>Having a financial cushion can help keep a family afloat during a terrible time when work may be the last thing on anyone's mind. If you absolutely have to bring in every cent of your paycheck to manage your family's finances, a life insurance policy for your kids could potentially protect you all from the devastating costs of grief.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Coverage protection</h2>\n<p>Something that never came up in Dad's comments about children's life insurance was the importance of future insurability. While a child's life insurance policy is generally much smaller than those purchased by adults, they will often include a rider known as the guaranteed additional purchase (GAP) that a child can rely on once he or she reaches adulthood. This GAP rider will allow the child to purchase additional coverage as an adult without medical questions or underwriting.</p>\n<p>I have seen firsthand just how important such coverage protection can be. My best friend's son was diagnosed with autism at 15 months of age. My friend had not purchased a life insurance policy for her baby, even though she had intended to do so.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this means her son is now permanently ineligible for life insurance because of his autism diagnosis. Once he reaches adulthood, he will not be able to purchase a policy for himself. And autism is only one of several juvenile medical diagnoses — including diabetes, severe asthma, cancer, or a heart condition — that can render a child ineligible for life insurance in the future.</p>\n<p>This is why my friend now recommends that every parent buy life insurance for their children when they are still babies. At the very least, it will allow the child to have coverage throughout his or her life, no matter what medical surprises may be in store.</p>\n<h2>Don't fall for the \"investment\" promises</h2>\n<p>Many children's life insurance policies provide an option to cash out the policy once the child reaches adulthood. There is nothing wrong with this — unless you are worried your kids will cash out the policy and go on a shopping binge — but it is hardly the \"investment\" that it is often touted to be. (In fact, you could make Dad go purple with outrage just by mentioning it.)</p>\n<p>For instance, the Gerber Grow-Up Plan, one of the most commonly advertised life insurance products for children, promises that \"each time you make a monthly premium payment for your [policy], Gerber Life sets aside a small amount of money. Over time, this becomes the cash value of your policy. It represents how much your policy is worth at any given point in time.\"</p>\n<p>However, the cash value can potentially be less than the amount you have paid in premiums, since only a portion of your premiums are set aside. And the cash value will certainly be less than you would have earned through a traditional investment had you invested the premiums instead.</p>\n<p>While there are legitimate reasons for choosing a life insurance policy for your child, the investment strategy is not one of them.</p>\n<h2>Buying life insurance for your kids is a personal decision</h2>\n<p>Despite my about-face on children's life insurance, my two sons are still uninsured. Dad's superstition about tempting fate has stuck with me — and my husband and I are lucky enough to be in a financial situation where we could handle the monetary costs if something terrible should happen. My only big concern is if either of my kids receive a diagnosis that will make them ineligible for future insurance. But we have decided to live with that risk.</p>\n<p>It's important that all parents think through the full consequences of buying or not buying life insurance for their children. It is a distressing train of thought, but a necessary one. No matter what you choose, a well-thought out decision will lead you to what's best for your family.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

However, some of us take it more seriously than others. And some of us have to take it seriously, because our professional success relies heavily on staying connected. Then there are people who are on their accounts all the time, even when they're trying to do other things, like hang out with actual people. But are you one of those people whose obsessed with social media? How would you even know?</p>\n<p>If you're worried about how much time you're wasting on various platforms, here are a few signs that it's time for a social media detox.

You feel anxious when you're not scrolling</h2>\n<p>When you're not online, do you wish you were? Do you wonder what you're missing, hope that people aren't doing anything fun without you, or just feel anxious when you can't be on social media for a while? This anxiety can be a sign that you need to take a break. You should feel more anxious about missing your real life than you do about your online one. Separating from social media for a period of time can help you realize that the world doesn't end when you're not liking posts and battling trolls.</p>\n<h2>2. The photos you see upset you</h2>\n<p>Do you regularly see photos of other people's lives that make you feel sad or envious? Do you wish you had that kind of access to fancy homes, creativity, or style? If you're constantly comparing yourself to people online and feeling like you fall short, it may be time to unplug. Take the time to remember how good your own life is.

You never put down your phone</h2>\n<p>Is your phone always in your hand or nearby, even when you're supposed to be working or having a real-life conversation? If you can't stop checking social media, it's time to put the phone down and walk away. Your online social life doesn't have to interfere with your real one. Delete some of the apps off your phone until they lose their hold over you.</p>\n<h2>4. You post about your life before you live it</h2>\n<p>When you're out living your life, do you stage photos specifically for social media? Are you spending a significant amount of time thinking of pithy statements to tweet? Do you think about what to post, or when, or how, even while you're in the middle of doing something fun or actively engaged in an activity? If you think about staging your life for Facebook or Instagram before you live it, it's time to put the phone in your pocket and enjoy what's in front of you.

You check social media without thinking about it</h2>\n<p>What do you do when you're bored? Do you automatically go online, just to be sure you haven't missed anything? If your first line of defense against boredom to check your social media accounts, or the first thing you do while you're waiting, you may need to take a break and find other, more meaningful ways to spend your time. Set up other things to do when you would usually check your accounts mindlessly, and take back your time, and your life.

Social media interferes with your productivity</h2>\n<p>Are you online when you should be doing something important? Do work tasks get put off or not done at all because you're scrolling and tweeting instead? If social media is interfering with your productivity, or your to-do list never gets done because you're online, make some changes today. Delete your most addictive apps and download a few task management apps instead to keep you focused.

You make excuses to check in often</h2>\n<p>When you're out with friends or family, do you find yourself making excuses for checking your social accounts? Maybe you tell them that it's for work, or you go to the bathroom with your phone just so you can check your notifications. If social media has such a strong pull on your life that your loved ones are calling you out and you're making excuses to stay connected, then it's high time to disconnect.</p>\n<h2>8. You're disengaging from your real life</h2>\n<p>Do you choose to be online rather than go out with friends? Sure, we all need the occasional evening in, but if you are regularly choosing social media over your friends, or choosing not to go out because you're afraid you'll miss something online, it's time to think about a break. Social media can have a place in your life, but it shouldn't frequently take the place of real-life interactions.

Raising kids in a two-parent household can be stressful enough; being a single parent can be downright overwhelming.</p>\n<p>When it comes to managing household finances, being a single parent isn't necessarily different from any other household with children. Instead, there just may not be a lot of financial flexibility — so there's more pressure to get things right early on. Take a breath and work toward reaching these financial markers to give you peace of mind.</p>\n<h2>1. Prepare your estate planning documents</h2>\n<p>People tend to procrastinate about getting their estate paperwork in place, but it's a smart idea for everyone to make it a priority. Experiencing a major life event, like having a child, should prompt you to either update your old documents or establish an estate plan.</p>\n<p>Unless you're comfortable leaving your personal and financial decisions up to state officials, it makes sense to sit with an attorney to discuss your wishes should you pass away or become incapacitated and unable to make financial and health decisions for yourself. Since minor children cannot take control of inheritance money or make legal decisions, listing them as direct beneficiaries on your accounts and assuming that will accomplish your goals may not be the case. Every parent should also have guardianship papers in place, especially if they are raising children alone.

Purchase life insurance</h2>\n<p>Generally, if someone is dependent on your income, you probably need life insurance. While you'll want to sit with a financial adviser or life insurance agent to discuss how much insurance you need, some factors to consider are how much it will cost to raise your children and send them to college, as well as to protect certain assets and pay off debt. You'll also want to consult an attorney or financial professional about properly selecting a policy beneficiary. While there are various types of life insurance, a term life insurance policy can be an affordable and efficient way to protect your family.

Fund an emergency savings account</h2>\n<p>Having a fully funded cash reserve on hand is a critical component of everyone's personal financial health. In a one-income household with children, it's recommended to work toward having <em>at least</em> six months' worth of monthly bills and expenses saved and set aside. Once you reach six months' worth, aim for a year's worth. In a two-parent household, one adult may be able to cut back on essentials in the case of a job loss, but when children are financially dependent on you and <em>only</em> you for everything, that can be difficult to manage without a padding of emergency cash. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-minute-finance-start-an-emergency-fund?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5-Minute Finance: Start an Emergency Fund</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Contribute to a retirement account</h2>\n<p>After fortifying your financial house with savings and the proper risk management documents in place, you should focus on saving for your own retirement. As a parent, you naturally put your children's needs and wants before your own, and there is nothing wrong with that. But it's also important to recognize that your early working years are critical to your retirement savings goals. There are no do-overs when it comes to saving for retirement, and every year you don't save is a year lost.</p>\n<p>If you have access to a retirement plan at work such as a 401(k), strive to save 15 percent of your total income. If money is tight and your employer offers a match, start by contributing just enough to earn the full match. Over time, you can gradually increase your own contributions. If you don't have access to a workplace retirement plan (or in addition to one), you should open an IRA, which you can do at a discount brokerage firm or bank. For 2018, anyone with earned income under the age of 50 can contribute the lesser of $5,500 or their total yearly income. Make this a priority and make this a habit.

Open a 529 account</h2>\n<p>A 529 plan is a tax-favored education savings account that allows individuals to save for future qualified education costs. Contributions are made on an after-tax basis, and the money grows tax-free. Distributions for qualified education expenses are also tax-free. Once you set up an account, anyone can make contributions to it; for example, grandparents could contribute on behalf of a grandchild. Even if you don't have enough money in your current budget to make regular contributions, saving your child's birthday, holiday, or other gift money they receive throughout the year can be a helpful way to see your funds grow.</p>\n<p>Covering the entire cost of your child's (or children's) college education is a difficult task for any set of parents, so don't feel guilty about what you may or may not be able to accomplish with this account. Every little bit helps.

There's something magical about splurging for a week away to try new activities with the kids. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/yes-affordable-family-travel-is-possible?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Yes, Affordable Family Travel Is Possible</a>)</p>\n<p>No dishes. No bills. No work calls or meetings with the boss. Just you and your kids enjoying life. We all need a break from the minutiae of daily life, right?</p>\n<p>Still, traveling with kids isn't all rainbows and cupcakes; it's also notoriously exhausting. Sleeping in a hotel room with children can be a challenge on its own, but there are also nap times, snack times, and meltdowns to deal with. It helps if the parents get a break every now and then.</p>\n<p>The ideal scenario is one where you travel with kids but also have a baby sitter on hand. You may not need full-time help, but even an hour or two each day can give you some space to relax in your own way. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/9-things-you-must-do-if-youre-traveling-with-kids?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">9 Things You Must Do If You're Traveling With Kids</a>)</p>\n<p>If you are someone who loves the idea of having child-care on a family vacation, consider these strategies.</p>\n<h2>1. Plan a vacation with built-in child-care</h2>\n<p>There are a few trips you can book where child-care is ready and waiting for you, the first of which is all-inclusive resorts. Many of these resorts are on the beach in destinations like the Caribbean and Mexico, and they offer your food, drink, lodging, and entertainment for one price.</p>\n<p>The majority of all-inclusive resorts also offer dedicated kids' clubs where you can drop your kids off for a few hours or the entire day. Some only allow you to drop off your kids for a few hours at a time, while others are open from morning until night.</p>\n<p>There are some <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/all-inclusive-resorts-you-can-book-for-free-with-points?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">all-inclusive resorts you can book with points</a> as well. The Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall in Montego Bay, Jamaica, for example, costs just 25,000 points per night (double occupancy) plus a 12,500 point per night supplement for each child. This resort includes food, drink, and fun, plus a kids' club that is open all day.</p>\n<h2>2. Book a cruise</h2>\n<p>Cruises are notorious for offering family-friendly (and affordable) fun, but part of that is the fact they have on-site child-care. The vast majority of major cruise lines offer some kind of kids' club that is open most or all of the day. Some cruise lines will even watch your child while you leave the ship at your cruise stop for the day.</p>\n<p>Many onboard kids' clubs offer much more than baby-sitting as well. On the MSC Divina, for example, kids participate in language lessons, crafts, games, and trivia. Not only are you getting child-care, but you're giving your children a unique experience of their own.</p>\n<h2>3. Travel with another family and swap baby-sitting</h2>\n<p>Imagine your family decides to rent a beach house with another family. You may save money by splitting the costs, and it can be convenient to have more adult eyes on all the kids. If you swap a night or two of baby-sitting, everybody wins.</p>\n<p>Still, this scenario won't always work. You would have to be able to settle on a place to stay with another family, and you would need to get along reasonably well to avoid conflict. Having access to child-care wouldn't be worth it if your family was miserable, so you would need to choose your tripmates wisely.

Book child-care through your hotel</h2>\n<p>While some hotels offer kids' clubs, there are just as many that offer child-care you can book separately from your room rate. If you stay at select Walt Disney Resorts, for example, you can book in-room baby-sitting starting at $18 per hour for one child ($21 for two; $24 for three; $26 for four). It's not cheap by any means, but it can give you a break to go out to dinner or enjoy some quiet time.</p>\n<p>Many Omni hotel properties also offer kids' clubs and baby-sitting for a fee. At the Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, a full day of child-care with lunch costs $77 for the first child and $57 for each additional child, for example.</p>\n<h2>5. Bring a vacation nanny on your trip</h2>\n<p>If you're taking a special trip and don't mind splurging, you can also bring a vacation nanny along. This might work best if someone you know is able to travel and care for your children. You would need to pay all their travel expenses at the very least, and you will likely need to pay them a daily rate as well.</p>\n<p>You could also <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-affordable-vacations-to-please-every-age-group?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">plan a multigenerational trip</a>, potentially bringing a grandparent or set of grandparents along. You may secure some child-care that way, although you should ask ahead of time to make sure your expectations will be met.</p>\n<p>If you don't know anyone who would work, you can also use a service to hire a vacation nanny. For example, NannyPoppinz.com makes it easy to hire vetted nannies that will travel where you are and provide child-care during your trip.</p>\n<p>For this to work, however, you would need to feel comfortable spending your vacation with a stranger. You would also need to have a relatively large vacation rental (suite, rental condo, rental home, etc.) so your nanny could have their own space.

Use child-care websites to find sitters nearby</h2>\n<p>If none of the above scenarios work for you, consider hiring as-needed baby-sitting in the destinations where you're traveling. Care.com and SitterCity.com are good resources when it comes to finding baby-sitting wherever you plan to be.</p>\n<p>According to Care.com, vacation baby sitters are paid an average rate of $12.50 per hour. The website makes it possible to browse options in your destination, read over caregiver qualifications, and ask questions.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you'll find someone who can baby-sit while you enjoy a dinner out, a daylong snorkeling trip, or a special event. You can even book a travel nanny for several days or nights during your vacation.</p>\n<p>When Mom and Dad are exhausted, it's more difficult to have the vacation of a lifetime. With child-care included, on the other hand, everyone gets the break they need.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

So far, the spewing and oozing lava from Kilauea has destroyed hundreds of homes and obliterated a scenic bay once popular for snorkeling. Near the volcano, residents have evacuated, not just because of the lava itself, but also because of air filled with ash, hydrochloric acid, and even particles of volcanic glass.</p>\n<p>The destruction has many mainlanders wondering if they should avoid making Hawaiian vacation plans this summer. Clearly, if you had plans to tour the volcano, you'll have to change your itinerary, since most of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park is closed. However, most of the Big Island and the rest of the Hawaiian Islands remain safe.</p>\n<p>\"Visitors to Hawai'i can be assured that the volcanic activity is having no effect whatsoever on the other islands, O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i, LÄna'i, and Kaua'i,\" said Governor David Ige in a news release.

Here's why:</p>\n<h2>1. Air quality is safe everywhere that you're allowed to go</h2>\n<p>Before leaving on your trip, you can check the Environmental Protection Agency's <a href=\"https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_state&amp;stateid=12&amp;mapcenter=0&amp;tabs=0\" target=\"_blank\">AirNow website</a> or its interactive <a href=\"https://response.epa.gov/site/map_list.aspx?site_id=12766\" target=\"_blank\">Air Monitoring Viewer</a>, created to track air quality during the eruption. The combination of ash and fog is referred to as vog, and although it's usually not dangerous, it can ruin a sunset.</p>\n<p>\"Consider KÄ«lauea has been erupting for 35+ years — with ocean entries on several occasions. Vog is, therefore, not something new. However, with the current increased activity, [it] may be more visible than normal depending on wind strength and direction,\" the Hawaii Tourism Authority states.</p>\n<p>Currently, neither site indicates that any areas of the Big Island have pollutant levels that would cause the general public harm. If you have a pre-existing medical condition that makes you more sensitive to pollutants in the air, consult these sites with your doctor before deciding to go.

The Big Island is huge and the lava area is small</h2>\n<p>It's certainly wise to look at a <a href=\"http://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/default/assets/File/news/06-04-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">map of the volcanic activity</a> to find out how far your chosen lodging is from the evacuation area. You can also check with your hotel or host. Officials are urging tourists not to try to get close enough to see the lava flow, for their own safety and to avoid further straining public safety resources.</p>\n<p>But chances are, you'll be staying miles away from the danger zone. Most hotels are in Kailua-Kona on the island's west coast or Hilo on the east coast, about 30 miles north of the lava area. The lava covers less than 10 square miles, or about 0.2 percent of the island.</p>\n<p>\"Let's put this into context,\" said Hawaii County Managing Director Wil Okabe in a news conference. \"All the islands in the Hawaiian chain can fit on the Big Island.\" He blamed the media, and confusion between the island of Hawaii and the state of Hawaii, for giving some mainlanders the impression that all of Hawaii is affected, instead of a tiny portion of one island.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. On the other islands, it's paradise as usual</h2>\n<p>The tourism board says no other islands in the state are affected. If you're staying in Waikiki, you'll be 200 miles away from the volcano; Kauai is more than 300 miles away. If you wouldn't cancel a trip to Las Vegas because of a natural disaster in Los Angeles, don't cancel a trip to another island because of what's happening on the Big Island.

Summer is one of the nicest times to visit Hawaii</h2>\n<p>While there is no <em>bad </em>time to visit Hawaii, many people (other than surfers) prefer June through September, when the ocean is warm and calmer than in winter months. There is also a lower chance of rain than in October, November, March, and April.</p>\n<h2>5. Hawaii needs you</h2>\n<p>Tourism is the largest single industry in Hawaii's economy, and on the Big Island, 30 percent of private sector workers are employed in tourism. The Big Island is already suffering due to the closure of the national park and because some cruise ships have stopped calling there. \"There are cancellations of vacations that affect the economy,\" said Okabe, who worried that mainlanders seeing volcanic eruption images in the media and on social networks were deciding not to go to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Officials say the effect on tourism revenue going forward will be difficult to predict, but the Island of Hawaii Visitors Bureau is projecting a potential 50 percent decline in business. Even more worrisome, some travel companies report that bookings to the entire state of Hawaii have declined, even though the other islands are not at all affected by the volcano.</p>\n<h2>6. You might benefit from smaller crowds on the Big Island</h2>\n<p>It's not clear whether volcano fears will lead to discounts for braver tourists this summer. But at the moment, July airfares from San Francisco to Kona, for example, look low — starting at $268 round-trip — compared to July averages in the $800 range, according to Kayak.com. Flights from the Bay Area to Honolulu can be had for as low as $258 in July.</p>\n<p>Whether or not you save money, you might enjoy fewer crowds, especially if you visit the Big Island. Fewer cruise ships calling at the ports of Kona and Hilo and less-full flights landing at the airports could mean more beach space for you — something to keep in mind especially if you're the type of traveler likely to be annoyed when a large ship pulls in.</p>\n<p>And if you think it's unseemly to head for an island enduring a natural disaster just to have a less-crowded holiday, consider all the people on the Big Island who rely on tourism to put food on their tables. They'll be happy you came.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Maybe you're looking for a new career, or perhaps you're just looking to build a side hustle that will bring in a few extra bucks. Either way, selling what you know online could turn out to be a great little earner for you.</p>\n<p>There are various ways to sell your knowledge over the internet, depending on what you are selling and the format you use. A few years ago, it might have required an advanced understanding of technology or a load of cash to get your idea off the ground, but these days, there are plenty of ways to get going with minimal upfront investment — making it easy for anyone with a computer and an internet connection to start a side hustle.

Write an ebook</h2>\n<p>It used to be that if you couldn't find a traditional publishing house that accepted your manuscript, then you'd have no other choice but to pay to have it printed yourself. Luckily, ebooks have blown the publishing world wide open and have enabled almost anyone to produce and sell a story directly to readers with very few costs attached. It also means that books are extremely quick to create. You can have your ebook ready to go not long after it's written.</p>\n<p>To go through Amazon, you can write the ebook in your normal word processing software, then format it with <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/GHU4YEWXQGNLU94T\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Create</a>, and create a cover for it in a free design program like <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Canva</a>. You can then self-publish it through Amazon's <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Direct Publishing</a>.</p>\n<p>But for wider distribution, look also at <a href=\"https://press.barnesandnoble.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NookPress</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/writinglife?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=5credit1F&amp;utm_campaign=kwl-branded&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-qO5r8u_2wIVQ57ACh2bSA8kEAAYASAAEgLqsPD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Kobo Writing Life</a>, which are other self-publishing platforms. For the widest reach possible, it's best to publish with all of the major players rather than sticking to a single one.</p>\n<h2>2. Host webinars</h2>\n<p>Hosting live webinar sessions allows you to share your knowledge to an audience without the need for them to be physically present. It's like a conference or seminar but done on a remote basis, saving learners the cost of travel and accommodation. The real benefit of webinars is that you can interact with your audience as you go, by allowing real-time questions or holding a Q&amp;A session at the end. This ensures that everyone gets exactly what they want from the session.</p>\n<p>Webinars can be simple presentations carried out on Skype or even Facebook Live, but more advanced tools will allow you to create better, more engaging seminars. Google Hangouts is free to use and has numerous collaborative features perfect for hosting web sessions.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, there are various paid software tools such as GoToMeeting or Cisco Webex that are specifically for designing and conducting webinars. You need to have an audience large enough to make it worth your while, so it helps if you already have a following on social media or a website to allow you to publicize the event.

Become an online consultant</h2>\n<p>For people with a sought after skill set that businesses want to access, online consulting works extremely well. There are many reasons why businesses prefer to work with online consultants rather than those who physically come onto the work premises. These range from not wanting to upset the workforce with an outsider's presence while still benefiting from a pair of fresh eyes, to the simple reality that it's often less costly to hire an online consultant while still receiving an expert level of service.</p>\n<p>It helps to have a niche skill that you have proven expertise in, as this will lend you much needed credibility. Getting started in online consulting can be difficult, so it's vital to use any and all contacts you already have to get your first break. Once you have your first few contracts secured, you will hopefully begin to get referrals or recommendations and see a snowball effect.</p>\n<h2>4. Provide online tutoring</h2>\n<p>Online tutoring is a great way to share your experience with people who want to learn one-on-one with an expert in their chosen subject. You don't need to have a degree in education, but you’ll need skills or knowledge in something that people are willing to pay to learn. Subjects like English, math, and science, are particularly in demand. However, it's possible to tutor online on other topics such as foreign languages (or English as a foreign language), or even learning an instrument.</p>\n<p>There are numerous online agencies that match people with tutors in their chosen subject, so you won't have to actively search or advertise for clients. Generally, you fill out an application and they decide whether they accept you or not. Once you've been accepted and have registered, they will send you jobs as they become available.

Create an online course</h2>\n<p>If you have knowledge that you want to spread far and wide, and know there's an audience there to lap it up, then an online course may be the right path for you. Online courses allow you to reach more people than you could on a one-on-one basis, both from a time perspective, and also because you can sell a course much cheaper than individual tutoring.</p>\n<p>It's a huge amount of work initially to design and build your course, but once this is done, the course should provide passive income with little to no further effort. There are various delivery methods that you'll have to select, depending on what you want to achieve. Courses that email your lessons to students are easy to set up with providers such as MailChimp, or you can put your materials out in module format with the Udemy marketplace.

Your children just want to enjoy time together, and there are plenty of ways to do that on a budget. Here are 28 free ways you can have a blast with them.</p>\n<h2>1. Head to the library</h2>\n<p>The library is a great resource for free books, and you can make your trip even more enjoyable by letting your kids pick out any books that interest them or by using a <a href=\"https://www.freekidscrafts.com/printable-library-scavenger-hunt/\" target=\"_blank\">printable library scavenger hunt</a> to discover new reads. It will keep them busy, they'll have tons of fun, and they'll end up with new books to enjoy. Check your library's calendar for fun activities and story times as well.

Turn your backyard into a water park</h2>\n<p>Turn on the sprinklers, have your kids change into swimsuits, and allow them to run wild. You can also add a tarp and some dish soap for a DIY slip and slide. It's really the perfect way to keep cool on a hot summer day.</p>\n<h2>3. Host a family game night</h2>\n<p>Pull out your board games and dedicate a whole night to playing a game together as a family. If you have a big family, you can play the games as teams and compete for a prize like, the winner gets to pick the movie on movie night, or the last place team has to do the dusting for the next week.

Let them play dress up in your clothes</h2>\n<p>Who needs fancy dress up costumes when Mom and Dad have dresses and suits to throw on? See what funny combos your kids can come up with and even organize a mock fashion show.</p>\n<h2>5. Create a fort in the living room</h2>\n<p>Hunkering down inside a homemade fort is a fun activity for kids and adults alike. All you need is a few chairs, some sheets or blankets, and a lot of comfy pillows to make the perfect indoor fort.</p>\n<h2>6. Have a camp out in the backyard</h2>\n<p>A camping trip won't always fit your schedule or budget, but you can still enjoy the experience by pitching a tent in the backyard. Roast hot dogs and s'mores outdoors with a grill or fire pit, tell ghost stories, and sleep under the stars. And make sure to use bug spray!</p>\n<h2>7. Bake some sweet treats</h2>\n<p>On a rainy day that can't be spent enjoying the summer sun, stay in and whip up some treats. Scour Pinterest for fun baking recipes to try out. What kid wouldn't want to make <a href=\"http://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/unicorn-poop-cookies/\" target=\"_blank\">unicorn poop cookies</a> or <a href=\"https://thedecoratedcookie.com/rainbow-smores-dip/\" target=\"_blank\">rainbow s'mores dip</a>?</p>\n<p>Or you can turn a regular meal into a game by letting the kids make funny food art. My girls always love when I turn their pancake breakfast into a dog, cat, or something holiday themed, like a turkey or Santa.</p>\n<h2>8. Have a picnic</h2>\n<p>Take meal time out in the fresh air with a picnic blanket and paper plates. Enjoy your family picnic at the park, in your backyard, or even in your living room if the weather isn't cooperating.</p>\n<h2>9. Make bath time extra fun</h2>\n<p>A bath with glow sticks, extra bubbles, or a few drops of food coloring can make tub time a blast. You can even add new toys or bring in water toys for the special occasion. Or you take bath time outside by filling a kiddie pool with bubble bath solution and letting kids get clean in their swimsuits.</p>\n<h2>10. Go hiking</h2>\n<p>A family hiking trip can be a wonderful bonding experience, especially if there is a lot of wildlife and plants to see along the way. Get kids more involved in the hike by making it a scavenger hunt or by bringing binoculars so they can birdwatch. <a href=\"https://www.americantrails.org/resources/statetrails/\" target=\"_blank\">American Trails</a> lists hiking and equestrian trails available in each state.

Have a spa day</h2>\n<p>Everyone loves a little pampering from time to time. Whip up DIY face masks for you and your kids from ingredients in the kitchen, like yogurt or avocado. Enjoy a bath with a homemade bath bomb or treat yourself and the kiddos to a mani/pedi and let them pick their own colors — even if it's a different color on each nail. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-spa-treatments-you-can-do-at-home?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Spa Treatments You Can Do at Home</a>)</p>\n<h2>12. Conduct a science experiment</h2>\n<p>No need to make your kids sit through a dull science lesson. Get them interested in the subject by trying fun experiments that will blow their minds like making <a href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/ice-cream3.htm\" target=\"_blank\">homemade ice cream</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Rock-Candy\" target=\"_blank\">rock candy</a>, or creating <a href=\"http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/experiments/invisibleink.html\" target=\"_blank\">invisible ink</a> for writing secret messages.</p>\n<h2>13. Hold an impromptu dance party</h2>\n<p>When your kids are complaining that they're bored or are fighting with each other, turn up the music and just start dancing. Watch the anger or antsiness fade into endorphins as they enjoy a subtle workout.</p>\n<h2>14. Visit Petsmart or Petco</h2>\n<p>My kids love going to the pet store just to walk around and look at the animals who've come in with their owners, and the smaller pets like fish that are available for adoption. Some locations have dog and cat adoption days on the weekends, so the kids can meet and pet four-legged friends, too!</p>\n<h2>15. Turn your garage into a roller skating rink</h2>\n<p>Clear out the garage, put on your skates, and blast some tunes for a fun DIY roller skating party. If you have a disco light, even better!</p>\n<p>You can also check out <a href=\"https://kidsskatefree.com/locations/\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Skate Free</a> to find free skating rink passes in your area.</p>\n<h2>16. Write and star in your own movie</h2>\n<p>Want your kids to take a break from the screen? Encourage them to make a movie or show of their own. If you don't have a video camera, you can use your smartphone and upload clips to a free movie editor, such as Blender or iMovie, to add special effects and cut and paste scenes.</p>\n<h2>17. Throw a tea party</h2>\n<p>Serve herbal tea, cookies, and tea sandwiches on your fanciest plates and drink with your pinkies up. Talk in accents or listen to a narrated audiobook like the <em>Harry Potter</em> series while you and your kids fancily dine.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>18. Blow some bubbles</h2>\n<p>Bubbles are not just for babies and toddlers. Older kids (and even adults) love them, too! Create giant bubbles with this <a href=\"https://happyhooligans.ca/homemade-giant-bubbles/\" target=\"_blank\">homemade recipe</a> or <a href=\"http://www.housingaforest.com/giant-ghost-bubbles-homemade-gak-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\">reusable bubbles</a> with items you already have on hand.</p>\n<h2>19. Try geocaching</h2>\n<p>Geocaching is where you hunt for a hidden object through GPS coordinates. Many people around the world have made the experience a thrilling one for families with kids to enjoy. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-outdoor-adventures-that-dont-cost-a-dime?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Outdoor Adventures That Don't Cost a Dime</a>)</p>\n<h2>20. Go bowling</h2>\n<p>Who doesn't love using a giant heavy ball to knock down several pins at once? Bowling is great for kids and adults, and it doesn't have to cost you a thing. Get free bowling passes through <a href=\"https://www.kidsbowlfree.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Bowl Free</a> or see if your local bowling alley gives away free games for good grades or birthdays.</p>\n<h2>21. Start a kids book club</h2>\n<p>Invite your children's friends over once a week for a book club meeting and read something that everyone will enjoy. Make themed snacks, crafts, or have the kids re-enact their favorite scenes.</p>\n<h2>22. Paint outside</h2>\n<p>Get creative without the mess. Use paint that you have on hand and make masterpieces on paper, rocks, or old shirts. You can even lay down an old bed sheet and let the kids paint with odd objects around the house, like a whisk or straw.</p>\n<h2>23. Set up a scavenger hunt</h2>\n<p>Hide a prize, such as a pan of brownies, and write and hide clues all over the house. They will have a blast solving riddles and trying to guess what the ultimate prize is.

Host family Olympic Games</h2>\n<p>Inspire some friendly competition among your family members by holding your own Olympic Games. If you have enough people to split into teams, you can even make your own uniforms with old T-shirts. Try fun games like a three-legged race, carrying an egg on a spoon, and water balloon toss.</p>\n<h2>25. Tour museums for free</h2>\n<p>Sign up for your local museum's mailing list to get notifications of free events and fee-free admission days.

Search <a href=\"http://www.factorytoursusa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FactoryToursUSA</a> under your state to discover free factory tours near you. There are 565 tours listed, and many of them with free or little admission cost.</p>\n<h2>27. Sign up for a free class</h2>\n<p>Many stores offer free classes for children. Check with your local library, bookstores, schools, and community center for more offerings.</p>\n<p>Here is a short list of free classes to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.americangirl.com/retail/\" target=\"_blank\">American Girl Store</a> occasionally offers free events and crafts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.michaels.com/classes\" target=\"_blank\">Michael's Craft store</a> offers free craft activities along with $2 and $5 craft classes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://shop.lego.com/en-US/minibuild-registration?ShipTo=US&amp;ShipTo=US&amp;_requestid=5506530&amp;_requestid=665480\" target=\"_blank\">LEGO store</a> allows children to complete a free mini-build once a month.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/workshops/?AID=11210757&amp;PID=8259874&amp;SID=103604X1560189X1bbde55f30fefa894195b95140e495a8&amp;cm_mmc=CJ-_-8259874-_-11210757&amp;cj=true#store/6651\" target=\"_blank\">HomeDepot</a> does a free workshop for kids each month.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>28. Visit a nearby farm</h2>\n<p>It's so important for kids to see where their food comes from, and visiting a local farm is the perfect way to show them. Use <a href=\"https://www.localharvest.org/\" target=\"_blank\">LocalHarvest</a> to find nearby farms and free events. You can also connect to pick-your-own farms near your area.

Of course you're going to pick up. What if it's the school nurse calling about your children? What if it's your dentist's office calling to reschedule an appointment?</p>\n<p>Then you pick up and a recording tells you that you've won a free cruise to Alaska or that you owe money to the IRS.</p>\n<p>Yes, you've been hit by a robocall. These obnoxious recorded messages are used by companies to persuade you to buy something you usually don't need. Not only are they annoying, but robocalls can be dangerous, too. Plenty of scammers use them to trick people into giving up their Social Security numbers, credit card digits, or other personal information. Worst of all? These robocalls are increasing, and so are complaints from consumers who have been harassed by those prerecorded pitches and scams.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are steps you can take to stop at least a chunk of these calls and to protect yourself from any automated scams targeting your phone number.</p>\n<h2>We're answering a LOT more robocalls lately</h2>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission reported that in 2017, consumers filed more than 4.5 million complaints with the commission about robocalls. That ranks as the highest number of complaints in any year, and is a sharp increase from the more than 3.4 million robocall complaints consumers filed with the FTC in 2016.</p>\n<p>The most common topic of these robocalls is debt reduction. Robocalls about vacations and timeshares were the second most common, while those about warranties and protection plans came in third.

Telemarketers are prohibited from using automated dialers to call cellphones or landlines on the list, unless the owners of these numbers give them consent first.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, listing your number on this list doesn't stop all robocalls. That's because many of the companies or scammers behind these calls won't hesitate to ignore Federal Communications Commission regulations.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Use call-blocking apps</h3>\n<p>Once you've listed your number on the Do Not Call Registry, it's time to download call-blocking apps that can help you prevent repeat robocalls from the same number. The <a href=\"https://mrnumber.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Number app</a> is a popular one, and allows you to block any number that has sent you a robocall and calls from known scammers. You can also block calls from numbers not in your contact list.</p>\n<p>There are competitors out there, including apps such as <a href=\"https://www.truecaller.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Truecaller</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shouldianswer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Should I Answer</a>. These will help you greatly reduce robocalls.</p>\n<p>Wireless providers understand that robocalls are a nuisance, too. So it's not surprising that some of these providers offer their own call-blocking apps. AT&amp;T offers the <a href=\"https://www.att.com/features/security-apps.html\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T Call Protect</a> app that lets you block calls from suspicious numbers and past robocallers. T-Mobile provides its own <a href=\"https://explore.t-mobile.com/callprotection?irgwc=1&amp;cmpid=WTR_AF_&amp;clickid=Vue3dj0vtTZuRm5WE2wp73T-UkjyWCRLETRN1Q0&amp;iradid=187812&amp;irpid=27795&amp;ircid=3290&amp;sharedid=&amp;aam=aam_uuid&amp;invoca=invoca_experience&amp;irmpname=VigLink\" target=\"_blank\">Scam Block</a> tool that allows cell users to block all known scam calls before they ring up their phones. And Verizon offers its own suite of <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/homephone/calling-features/stop-unwanted-calls\" target=\"_blank\">call-blocking services</a>, including call block, caller ID, and anonymous call rejection.</p>\n<h2>What to do if you still get robocalls</h2>\n<p>What if, despite the measures you've taken to prevent them, you still receive a robocall?</p>\n<p>First, if your call is coming from a number you don't recognize, don't answer. If the call truly is important, whoever is calling will leave you a voicemail. If you do answer, hang up as soon as you realize you're dealing with a robocall.</p>\n<p>Some robocalls will request that you hit the number \"1\" to speak with a live operator. Never do this. You'll just be connected with someone trying to sell you something or scam you. Others might ask that you press a certain number on your phone to stop receiving calls. Don't press that number, either. You'll usually be connected to another operator who wants to sell you or scam you.</p>\n<p>In short, the best way to deal with robocalls that slip through is to never engage with them. Robocallers can't scam you if you don't answer.

Most imply that you need to be rich, that only certain privileged people can travel, and that common life situations make it impossible to see the world. But safe and affordable travel is actually possible. Here are seven common travel myths that are flat-out wrong.</p>\n<h2>1. Traveling is too expensive</h2>\n<p>There's no doubt about it, traveling can absolutely be expensive. But that doesn't mean it <em>has </em>to be. If you're booking luxury cruises and five-star hotels every time you go on vacation, then yes, you'll need lots of cash. There are endless ways to make traveling easier on your budget, though, and all while enjoying a fantastic standard of living.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-wisely-choose-your-next-travel-destination?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Choosing the right destinations</a> is key, and outside of the U.S., many places are far cheaper on everything from food to accommodation. You can use travel rewards credit cards to save hundreds of dollars per year and get free travel perks. And <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/why-timing-is-everything-when-saving-money-on-travel?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">timing your trip</a> is another way to keep costs down, simply by traveling outside of peak seasons.</p>\n<h2>2. Travel credit cards are bad for your finances</h2>\n<p>Credit cards are only as dangerous as the person wielding them, so it's completely inaccurate to assume that the cards themselves are dangerous for your finances. When used correctly, <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">travel rewards cards</a> can actually be of huge benefit for travelers. They’re a great way to earn free bonuses just for doing your everyday spending, and savvy travelers use them to score everything from <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-tools-that-help-you-find-free-award-flights?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">free flights</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/which-credit-card-should-you-use-to-get-free-hotel-stays?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">free hotel stays</a>.</p>\n<p>Rewards credit cards are most suitable for people who are already debt-free and able to pay off their balance each month. It's also important not to increase your spending in order to gather rewards, as this will rarely make financial sense.</p>\n<h2>3. Couchsurfing is unsafe</h2>\n<p>Couchsurfing sometimes gets a bad rap, and people tend to focus on the few horror stories that appear in the news. The reality is that most people have a fantastic experience when couchsurfing, and trouble with hosts or guests is extremely rare. <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/tips-for-safe-couchsurfing/\" target=\"_blank\">Travel blogger Rachel Jones</a> is a fan of couchsurfing, and has found that it gives her a more immersive local experience. She has even made long-lasting friendships through it. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/13-ways-to-get-free-travel-accommodations?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">13 Ways to Get Free Travel Accommodations</a>)</p>\n<p>There are precautionary steps you should take as a guest when looking for a couchsurfing opportunity that is right for you. First, read the host profiles carefully, particularly the reviews, as these will give you an insight into the person you'll be staying with. Second, always give a friend or family member the address you're heading to before you go, and arrange to check in with them throughout your stay. Finally, don't be afraid to walk away. If alarm bells ring in your head, listen to your instincts and leave.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Traveling with kids is a nightmare</h2>\n<p>Traveling with kids can be difficult, and it's certainly more complicated than traveling alone. But that doesn't mean that it should stop you from doing it. There are plenty of families successfully navigating the world with multiple kids in tow, and absolutely loving the experience.</p>\n<p>Some destinations are more child-friendly than others, so it pays to do your research before choosing. It will also take a bit more planning to find suitable accommodations and ensure you have packed everything you need to make the trip enjoyable for everyone. But there are lots of useful resources filled with great information to help you out. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-handle-world-travel-with-your-family?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Handle World Travel With Your Family</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Traveling solo is too dangerous for women</h2>\n<p>There's an entire genre of travel blogging that has grown out of the desire to crush the belief that solo travel is inherently dangerous for women. Not only is it outdated and sexist, but it's also incorrect. There are female solo travelers making their way to every corner of the globe, safely and expertly.</p>\n<p>That's not to say that there aren't precautions that solo female travelers should take to keep themselves safe. But they're exactly the same ones that apply to any kind of solo traveler, regardless of gender. Stay alert, do your research, don’t tell strangers where you’re staying, do let close friends and family know where you’re going, and consider joining a tour group if you’re uncomfortable on your own.

You can't work overseas</h2>\n<p>While it's not as simple as packing up, boarding a flight, and finding a suitable position in your chosen country, it's not impossible to work overseas. For 18–30-year-olds, there are working holiday visas that the U.S. government has set up with New Zealand, Ireland, South Korea, Singapore, and Australia that allow you to work overseas for up to two years with relatively few restrictions.</p>\n<p>If you don't qualify for one of those, then you can still work overseas as long as you have the correct visa. You should also be aware of U.S. tax regulations, meaning you'll likely still have to file returns. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-tax-myths-that-can-be-costly-for-expats?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Tax Myths That Can Be Costly for Expats</a>)</p>\n<h2>7. You have to have enough money for your whole trip before you leave</h2>\n<p>If you're planning on traveling for a long period of time, it can be daunting to save up the exact amount of money you need to cover your whole journey. But the truth is, you don't <em>have</em> to. It's entirely possible to set off with a limited amount of cash and earn money as you make your way around the world.</p>\n<p>There are countless ways to make money while you travel that are open to anyone, and if you have some skills that enable you to work remotely, then even better. From hospitality work to web design, there are lots of occupations you can do from anywhere in the world. Just make sure you've saved enough to get yourself started before hitting the road.

Many of us can remember our parents complaining that money didn't grow on trees and grumbling over wasted money every time we left a light on or took too long in the shower. As our parents get older, however, roles and responsibilities start to switch. Eventually, a time comes when we have to have the talk about money with our parents.</p>\n<p>Sharing financial advice with your parents can be challenging and uncomfortable, but it is an essential talk to have. Here's how you can go about discussing money with your aging parents in both a respectful and productive way.</p>\n<h2>Set up a meeting</h2>\n<p>It can be hard to talk seriously when kids are running around or when the family is supposed to be enjoying a fun night together. Don't put a damper on a family get together by blindsiding your parents with bank statements. Instead, arrange to talk over coffee or breakfast, or even agree to meet with a financial adviser or estate planner if you think that will make the meeting go smoother.

From your perspective, it might seem like your parents have been careless with finances, but there is a chance that you don't know the whole story. Instead, approach them on mutual grounds.</p>\n<p>Instead of being accusatory, invite discussion. Start off the conversation with something like, \"I would love to discuss what you would you want me to do if there comes a time that I need to be your full-time caregiver,\" or, \"I know you mentioned that you wanted to set aside money for your grandkids' education, and I would love to know more about it so that it is done in a way that the kids aren't penalized if they need to apply for financial aid later on.\"</p>\n<h2>Offer help</h2>\n<p>Ask Mom and Dad if there is anything you can do to help lighten their load. They might need someone to teach them how to access their bank info online, do their taxes, or help them prepare a will. Sometimes parents feel embarrassed about asking their kids to take over financially, and may not be ready to hand over the reins right away. You can still extend the invitation by saying something like, \"If there ever comes a time where you don't want to deal with budgeting/paying bills/etc., let me know and I will gladly help out as much as possible.\"</p>\n<h2>Ask for access to their important financial information</h2>\n<p>There are no guarantees in life. You never know when your parents will pass away or become fully dependent on you. It is important to have a list of their financial information so that you can access it when the time comes. Here are some important things to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Social Security numbers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Financial information for each bank, investment, retirement, and debt account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All insurance information, including health, long-term care, and life insurance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Estate planning documents such as will, trust, and power of attorney.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real estate papers, such as deed and title.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact information for all financial advisers, accountants, lawyers, etc.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Create a future plan</h2>\n<p>According to AARP, 30 million households care for an adult over 50, and that number is expected to double in 25 years. Share that statistic with your parents and explain to them that while you don't like imagining them getting older, that is going to happen regardless — and you want their guidance and advice before that time comes. Ask them what living arrangements they want when they can't care for themselves and how they want their finances, assets, and property dealt with after passing.

Does their will and power of attorney for health and finances reflect what they want it to reflect? If not, encourage them to update these legal documents as soon as possible. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-things-youll-encounter-when-taking-over-a-loved-ones-finances?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Things You'll Encounter When Taking Over a Loved One's Finances</a>)</p>\n<h2>Have patience and get the family involved</h2>\n<p>Don't expect to conquer your parents' financial future in one go. Depending on how complicated their finances are, it might take several talks and several prompts of encouragement to get things on the right track. If possible, have other siblings get involved in these financial conversations. Show siblings that if they keep borrowing money from Mom and Dad, they will drain them of essential money needed to pay for health care and living expenses down the road.</p>\n<p>Talking about money is already an uncomfortable and unpopular topic. Add your parents to the mix, and things can get hairy and emotional quick. Remember to go slow and come from a place of love.

Thankfully, they don't need it — because plenty of free, open source software is available online at the click of a button.</p>\n<p>Many of the free versions of business software cover, at minimum, the basic needs required by startups and self-employed individuals. Check out a few below. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-helpful-tools-to-manage-your-small-business?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Helpful Tools to Manage Your Small Business</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Google Drive</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Drive</a> is a free service that gives users access to spreadsheets, word processing, slideshows, and form software. The drive is tied to Gmail accounts. Each user has access to 15GB of cloud storage under a free account.</p>\n<p>These free tools don't have the same level of robust options as Microsoft's suite of office software, but they offer most of the common features that small businesses will be looking for. As an added bonus, the documents are updated in real time, so it's a solid choice for companies that do real-time collaboration on projects.</p>\n<p>Drive allows users to upload and download documents in a Microsoft format, so you will not have problems sharing documents with clients, customers, or partners who utilize Office.</p>\n<h2>2. LibreOffice</h2>\n<p>LibreOffice is a free collection of open source office tools that gives users access to downloadable spreadsheets, word processing, and presentation software. It's important that you only download the software on the <a href=\"https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/\" target=\"_blank\">LibreOffice website</a> to avoid potential computer viruses.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is a pretty solid alternative to Microsoft Office. LibreOffice Writer has most of the major and minor features found in Microsoft Word. LibreOffice Calc also has similar features to Excel, but Microsoft macro and programming language can't be imported from Calc to Microsoft Excel. The presentation software (Impress) has similar compatibility issues with PowerPoint.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that LibreOffice is a good alternative if your business doesn't receive Excel files with macros and doesn't need to send presentations to individuals who utilize PowerPoint.</p>\n<h2>3. Evernote</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://evernote.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Evernote</a> is a \"freemium\" application (free to download and use, with additional paid features) that can be used for word processing, slideshows, note taking, and document storage. The main perk of the platform is the ability to easily store and organize various types of documents in one place.</p>\n<p>The basic platform is free and allows users to upload 20MB of new content each month and sync it across two devices. It's a neat tool, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as your sole project management software. The basic freemium plan doesn't offer a robust means of sharing documents internally and externally.</p>\n<h2>4. Prezi</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://prezi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Prezi</a> is online presentation software. A basic, free account allows individuals to create an unlimited number of presentations, but has no miscellaneous options, such as offline sync, privacy controls, or revocable shared links.</p>\n<p>The tool, despite its limited scope, is worth evaluating because the presentations that can be created aren't typical, old-fashioned slideshows. Presentations are shown on large slides that offer the presenter smart capabilities like zooming in on certain details.</p>\n<h2>5. Trello</h2>\n<p>The basic, free version of project management software <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Trello</a> gives members the ability to create an unlimited number of lists, cards, and checklists. Members can upload up to 10MB of files.</p>\n<p>The free version of Trello only has two major downsides. First, basic accounts lack the ability to put the lists and cards into collections to make the system easier to navigate. Second, users aren't able to remove group members. The basic account relies heavily on the honor system and managers externally policing how individuals interact with the tool. As your company grows, you might want to invest in a paid project management and organization tool.</p>\n<h2>6. SurveyMonkey</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SurveyMonkey</a> is a survey creation tool. The free version allows individuals to create a 10 question survey. Each survey can have up to 100 responses.</p>\n<p>Which should you use, Google Forms or Survey Monkey? Survey Monkey tends to be a tad more aesthetically pleasing, but Google Forms allow the survey to have more than 10 questions. I'd recommend using Google Forms if you regularly create long surveys.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>7. Buffer</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://buffer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buffer</a> is a social media management platform that serves as a valuable marketing tool. A basic, free Buffer account allows users to manage up to three social accounts at one time. Each account can have 10 posts in the schedule queue.</p>\n<p>Due to the limitations, I'd recommend this for businesses or individuals who don't rely heavily on preplanning a large number of social media posts. The free plan also, unfortunately, does not give users access to valuable analytics data for a more targeted social campaign.</p>\n<p>Despite those restrictions, it can be a valuable tool for small businesses and freelancers until they can invest in a more robust social media management plan.</p>\n<h2>8. Google Hangouts</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Hangouts</a> allows organizations to create video calls, phone calls, and online chat forums. The tools are free and can be accessed through users' Gmail accounts.</p>\n<p>Video and audio calls can have up to 10 active participants; individuals who video call can use screen share to give presentations, as well as share documents, websites, and videos. Google Conversations — the chat feature of Hangouts — can have up to 150 participants.</p>\n<h2>9. Slack</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack's</a> main function serves as a robust interface for team chat and collaboration. The free version also has the ability to make one-on-one voice and video calls, offers 5GB of file storage, and allows users to search through a history of the previous 10,000 messages.</p>\n<h2>10. Audacity</h2>\n<p>Audacity is open source audio editing software that can be downloaded on Microsoft, Mac, and Linux computers. You should only download the software from the <a href=\"https://www.audacityteam.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\">official Audacity website</a>.</p>\n<p>Audacity allows users to import or record audio files. Once audio files are uploaded or recorded, they can be combined and edited. The first time a business or freelancer utilizes the software to create a piece of audio content, I'd recommend they consult one of the dozens of video guides available on YouTube. Experts of the software can, at the very least, give inexperienced recorders tips that might save them hours of work.</p>\n<h2>11. GIMP</h2>\n<p>GIMP is a free photo editing program that is compatible with most operating systems. Like LibreOffice and Audacity, GIMP should be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">official GIMP website</a>.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that GIMP, as an open source, community-built program, isn't as advanced as Adobe Photoshop. GIMP has basic editing functions, but lacks many of the higher quality functions present in Photoshop.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals who either lack the capital to invest in Photoshop or don't require advanced photo editing software should give GIMP a try.</p>\n<h2>12. Canva</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Canva</a> is a \"freemium\" graphic design tool that lets businesses and freelancers create featured images and graphs that can be utilized on their websites, blogs, or promotional materials. Canva can be accessed online or by downloading the app on a variety of tablets and smartphones.</p>\n<p>A free Canva account has 1GB of storage and gives up to 10 team members access to the software. Novice image editors can streamline the photo editing process by choosing one of the 8,000 image templates as a guide. Users can either upload their own images or purchase an image through Canva.</p>\n<p>If you're not quite up to delving into GIMP for your photo editing needs, Canva can be easier to utilize.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n              <div id=\"below-content\" class=\"mobile-ad\">\n                  </div>\n      \n    </div>", "body_type": "html", "lang": "en", "timestamp": "2025-10-13T05:47:30.495522"}

It can also be expensive. A trip to the movies for a family of four can easily set you back $80 or more after the tickets and snacks. Entrance fees to water parks and amusement parks are just as expensive, and even a meal at a local restaurant can empty your wallet. But if you get creative, you can give the grandkids a great time without fretting about the cost.</p>\n<h2>1. Head to McDonald's</h2>\n<p>There's always an outcry from a select set of people when you mention McDonald's. Whatever you think of the golden arches franchise, it's hard to deny the convenience and wonder of the PlayPlace. It's completely free, it's well-maintained, and the kids <em>love</em> it. It's bright, it's full of other excited kids, and grandparents can watch the grandkids from a comfy bench. You don't even have to order a meal to access it. Split a coffee or bottle of water and watch the kids have a blast.</p>\n<h2>2. Check out a local playground</h2>\n<p>Most suburban housing areas have a Homeowners' Association (HOA) that takes care of garbage, snow removal, and the upkeep of a safe, secure playground. They usually have some kind of climbing frame, swings, monkey bars, and lots of room to play.</p>\n<p>You can often find several of these playgrounds within a few minutes' drive from each other, so take the kids on a kind of playground treasure hunt. Drive around the neighborhoods, and when they find a park they like, go play! There are usually benches right there at the park for the parents and grandparents to take a load off while the kids run around.</p>\n<h2>3. Visit the local public library</h2>\n<p>Your taxes have paid for this essential resource, and over the years public libraries have become modernized multimedia learning centers. You'll find all kinds of books, movies, and CDs that the kids will enjoy. Libraries also offer free activities for children, including readings by authors, movie screenings, puppet shows, crafts, science corners, and even poetry jams. Many libraries also offer refreshments at very reasonable prices, and have used books, DVDs, and CDs for sale at low prices. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-modern-reasons-to-visit-your-local-library-today?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Modern Reasons to Visit Your Local Library Today</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Take advantage of free days at national parks</h2>\n<p>While it usually costs a small fee, either per car or per person, visiting a national park on certain days of the year is actually free. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/fee-free-parks.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Those days in 2018</a> are January 15, April 21, September 22, and November 11. So pack a picnic and go see the sights at a national park for $0. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-save-on-national-park-visits-in-2018?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Save on National Park Visits in 2018</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Try a free craft session at Home Depot or Lowe's</h2>\n<p>Hardware stores know that by offering these free crafts for the kids, the parents will visit the store and end up making a purchase. But you don't have to buy anything. Simply visit your nearest <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/workshops/#change_store\" target=\"_blank\">Home Depot</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lowes.com/cd_Childrens+Corner+and+Gifts+at+Lowes_751688466_\" target=\"_blank\">Lowe's</a> when they next have a kid's craft session, and watch the grandkids have an awesome time assembling a bird feeder, or wooden car, or play with sand and special tools. Whatever the grandkids make, they get to keep and bring home. It's a fun, free activity that takes up a few hours, usually on a Saturday morning.</p>\n<h2>6. Take them to a free concert</h2>\n<p>Free summer concerts are usually hosted by counties looking to help increase trade at malls, farmers markets, or other shopping venues, and it works. People come out for the free music, and spend money on food trucks, toys, rides, and more. Again, you don't have to spend any money if you don't want to. Get online and search for \"free concerts near me\" and just watch the results come flooding in. They're usually outdoor, rain-or-shine events, and you will have to provide your own seats and blankets. But it's a great way to spend a few hours watching the grandkids dance and have fun, while getting involved in something positive for your community.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>7. Go bowling for free</h2>\n<p>Bowling centers in towns and cities all across America are participating in a program called <a href=\"https://www.kidsbowlfree.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Bowl Free</a>. Register your grandkids and they will each receive two free games of bowling each day over the summer, a giveaway valued at over $500 per child. Find out which centers near you are involved in the initiative. If you want to join in, many bowling centers offer discounted rates for seniors, and you can also find great deals on sites like Groupon and LivingSocial.</p>\n<h2>8. Have a picnic</h2>\n<p>Kids spend way too much time indoors these days, so get them outside to a local park for a family picnic. You don't have to do anything fancy, all you need are a few blankets, folding chairs, some snacks, and maybe a few balls and Frisbees for the kids to throw around.</p>\n<p>Before you head out, have the grandkids help with the food preparation. It's a great way to get them feeling more independent, and they'll be invested in the whole experience. Making sandwiches, bagging up fruits and veggies, and making lemonade or ice water is another fun activity for them. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/20-cheap-fun-things-to-do-this-summer?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">20 Cheap, Fun Things to Do This Summer</a>)</p>\n<h2>9. Visit a museum on a free day</h2>\n<p>Kids hear the word \"museum\" and they think of dusty sculptures, old paintings, and tired fossils. However, modern museums are jam-packed with the most incredible interactive exhibits, often showcasing great pop culture events. The recent <a href=\"http://www.powerofcostume.si.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Star Wars</em> and the Power of Costume</a> traveling exhibit from the Smithsonian was a smash hit, and kids everywhere flocked to the museums with their parents and grandparents.</p>\n<p>Most museums offer free days, and offer discounts for seniors, so plan a trip to a museum (they get busy on free days, so go early) and introduce your grandkids to the many wonders of the world. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-visit-museums-for-free?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Visit Museums for Free</a>)</p>\n<h2>10. Get them working in the garden</h2>\n<p>Don't make them do backbreaking work, but the kind of fun gardening that kids love to do. Have them help pulling weeds, plant flowers, prune bushes (with adult supervision), water the plants, and other gardening tasks that can be a chore for you, but a good time for them. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/13-simple-gardening-skills-anybody-can-master?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">13 Simple Gardening Skills Anybody Can Master</a>)</p>\n<h2>11. Turn the sprinklers on</h2>\n<p>While you're out in the garden, if it's a nice sunny day and the watering restrictions in your area allow it, get the sprinklers going. The grandkids can put on their swimsuits and run around in the water for hours. You can find cheap attachments at most major stores for hoses that are specifically designed to sprinkle out water in fun patterns, and you can also pick up a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LcHCAI\" target=\"_blank\">Slip 'n' Slide</a> for about $20.</p>\n<h2>12. Go fly a kite</h2>\n<p>Make a kite, and then go and fly it with the grandkids. There are instructions online for many different types of kites that you can make for pennies, using items you'll find around the house, or, you can pick up cool and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IR2JKE\" target=\"_blank\">colorful kites</a> for $10-$20.

Earlier this week, the head administrative assistant asked everyone to chip in $20 for an upcoming retirement party. And you know that Ted from accounting is going to hit you up for a donation toward that charitable 10K he's been training for.</p>\n<p>While you're happy to support all of these coworkers and their causes individually, together it's getting to be a major financial burden.</p>\n<p>So how do you keep these regular solicitations from wrecking your carefully planned budget? Here's what you need to know about navigating this financial and etiquette minefield.

But you have every right to refuse to give, no matter who is asking. You don't need to give a reason or an excuse. You simply need to say no. </p>\n<p>Perfecting your polite \"No\" will go a long way to making sure these requests leave no hard feelings on either side. Here are some ways to refuse graciously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\"No, thank you.\"</strong> It's an old standby for a reason. If your coworker presses, you can say that you appreciate their passion for the cause, but you're not interested.<br>\n     </li>\n<li><strong>\"I've already allocated all of my charitable spending for the year.\" </strong>This is polite, to the point, and not something anyone can argue with.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\"I don't donate to organizations unless I have done my own research on them.\"</strong> This makes it clear to the office solicitor that you ultimately get to decide where your money goes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Know your workplace policy</h2>\n<p>Many companies are well aware of how uncomfortable workplace solicitations can be, since you're a captive audience for the solicitor-du-jour, and you have to maintain a pleasant working environment with them, to boot. That's why it's common for workplaces to have solicitation policies. These policies will often prohibit one-on-one solicitations between employees, but allow more general solicitations. </p>\n<p>For instance, your workplace may not allow the father of a girl scout to go desk-to-desk asking each of his coworkers how many boxes of Thin Mints he can put them down for, but will allow him to put a sign-up sheet in the break room for those interested. </p>\n<p>If you're feeling pressured to give, start by finding out the specific policy in place. If multiple coworkers are not adhering to the policy, then you can say something to HR or your manager about making sure everyone knows the policy. </p>\n<p>But what if there is no policy in place?</p>\n<p>\"Tell someone!\" recommends HR professional Jenni Stone. \"Solicitation only becomes a problem when it becomes disruptive. This repeated solicitation and pressure is unacceptable. Let management know what's going on so it can be addressed through creating and enforcing a policy.\" (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/10-ways-to-improve-your-companys-culture-even-if-you-arent-the-boss?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 Ways to Improve Your Company's Culture, Even If You Aren't the Boss</a>) </p>\n<h2>Develop a personal policy</h2>\n<p>Even if there's no policy in place at work, you can still create a policy for yourself regarding donations. Having such a policy for yourself can help you say no comfortably without feeling cornered, since you've already made the decision before the sign-up sheet has gone around.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple of ways to shape your policy:</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Never give at work</h3>\n<p>If you have a flat refusal in place because you don't give money at work, then Rhonda in marketing won't be wondering why you gave to Keisha's fundraiser but not hers. If this is your policy, you could say you've budgeted for charitable donations and take care of it entirely outside of work. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/10-money-moments-that-are-awkward-for-everyone?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 Money Moments That Are Awkward for Everyone</a>)</p>\n<h3>Only give in specific categories</h3>\n<p>Decide ahead of time that you will only donate to certain categories of charities. For instance, you might decide you'll only support children, education, and the arts. That makes it easier to say no if a coworker is raising money for their church or for medical research. Those are worthy causes, but they're not in the categories you've chosen to support.</p>\n<h3>Make a charitable budget</h3>\n<p>Determine the amount of money you're willing to spend on office solicitations. That could be an overall budget — like $150 for the year — or an amount like $5 per solicitation. If you choose an overall budget, you can tell anyone asking after you've used up the $150 you'd allotted that you've reached the end of your budget and to try you again next year. If you choose the $5 per request, that will allow you to support everyone without destroying your overall budget.</p>\n<h2>Pressure from management</h2>\n<p>There's an added layer of stress when the solicitation comes from above. For instance, I used to work with kids for a nonprofit charitable organization. I earned less than $10 an hour in my role as an art teacher with the organization. However, the charitable non-profit wanted to show potential donors how much the employees believed in the mission. We were all \"encouraged\" to give money during the annual fundraising campaign so they could say that they had 100 percent employee participation.</p>\n<p>A similar pressure can occur when your workplace encourages you to give money toward a retirement party, wedding or baby gifts for coworkers, or to help a sick employee. You can often feel like you have no choice but to give money toward these causes, even if you're feeling financially strapped.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of ways to handle these kinds of uncomfortable solicitations. The first is to only give what you can. When I was struggling to make ends meet working for the non-profit organization, I gave $2 toward the annual campaign one year. The higher ups made it clear they didn't care how much you gave, since getting 100 percent participation was their main goal.</p>\n<p>In addition, remember that you can always ask if there are other ways to be supportive. Some employers will allow you to donate sick time or vacation time to coworkers. Donating a day or two of the leave you've built up could be a great way to give to an ailing coworker or a new parent without spending money.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you could offer to set up the retirement party, bake the cake, or even run the errands necessary for the party in your off time. That shows you care without hurting your bottom line.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Between one-click purchases, instant downloads of new movies and music, quick stops for something to eat, and impulse purchases in stores, it's entirely possible to spend an entire paycheck in a day without even realizing.</p>\n<p>But just because it's easy to spend money without thinking doesn't mean you have to fall victim to it. The following mindful spending strategies can help you resist impulse buys long enough to help you remember what you truly value.</p>\n<h2>Calculate costs in hours spent</h2>\n<p>While money is replaceable, time can only be spent, not earned. That's why it's helpful to start thinking of prices in terms of hours, rather than dollars. Remembering that you've already traded your time for the money you plan to spend on whatever has caught your fancy can be enough to help you keep your cash in your wallet. </p>\n<p>Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez popularized this strategy in their book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KztfqW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Your Money or Your Life</em></a>, where they make the case that your time is literally money, since you trade your time away in order to get money. When you calculate costs in hours spent, you determine the amount of money you net per hour, and compare that number to the cost of goods and services to buy. With your calculation in hand, you have a better sense of how much time any one purchase costs you.</p>\n<p>To put this strategy into action, start with your monthly income. Check your pay stubs to see how much you make per month. Multiply your monthly net income by 12 to get your annual income, then divide it by 2,000 (the typical number of hours worked in a year) to get your hourly wage.</p>\n<p>Let's say your monthly income is $3,100. If you multiply that by 12, you get $37,200. Divided by 2,000, you get an hourly wage of $18.60.</p>\n<p>Having that number in your head can re-contextualize prices, because it gives you a concrete value of your hours. When you're tempted by a home assistant device that's on sale for $150, the price may seem like no big deal. But is it worth 8.06 hours of your work time? </p>\n<p>You may ultimately decide that having a home assistant device is worth just over a day of work — and that's absolutely fine. Calculating prices in hours worked means that you're actually clear on what the true costs are.</p>\n<h2>Know why you're shopping</h2>\n<p>Eating and shopping can both feel very good in the moment, to the point where you ignore any signals that tell you that you've had enough. Like eating, we often spend money because we want to change our emotional state. And in both cases, there's a huge industry in place trying to keep us mindless, continuing to ignore signals and consume in order to avoid emotions.</p>\n<p>To combat this, get several blank index cards. Place these where you'll see them anytime you might spend money. For instance, put one in front of your credit cards in your wallet, one on your laptop, and one taped to the back of your phone. On each card, write the following questions for yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why do I want to buy this?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>What problem do I expect this purchase to solve?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>How do I expect to feel after making this purchase?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>How long do I expect to own this item/use this service?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Do I already own something similar?<br>\n     </li>\n<li>Can I recreate the feeling of buying this without spending money? <br>\n     </li>\n<li>Can I recreate the feeling of buying this by spending less money?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's important to check in with yourself to understand why you're consuming so you can stop if it's not what you really want, or engage mindfully so you can truly enjoy the process if it is what you want.

Forcing yourself to wait to decide if you actually want to spend money on an item can help mitigate the emotional element of spending decisions. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>However, if you've ever tried to institute such a rule for yourself, you'll remember the \"I don't wanna wait!\" reaction that can derail the entire process. Even though you might be aware of these impulse-driven moments, it can still be tough to stand up to that foot-stomping part of yourself insisting on making the purchase right now.</p>\n<p>One method of both calming and honoring the little Veruca Salt inside you is to keep a purchase wish list. When you find something you absolutely want to buy, quickly write down what it is, where and when you found it, and how much it costs. Once you've written it down, set a date anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days in the future when you may come back to make the purchase, if you still want it. </p>\n<p>There are two benefits to this list:</p>\n<h3>You create self-awareness</h3>\n<p>You're recognizing the part of yourself that wants to give in to the impulse purchase. It does feel good to buy things on a whim. It would be fun to have whatever cool thingamajig you're pining for. Writing down all the details about the potential purchase is a way to honor the reality of your spending desires. You're not wrong for wanting the item, and making this list can help you feel more at peace with leaving it behind at the store or in your digital cart because you've honored your emotional reaction to it.</p>\n<h3>You train yourself to resist impulse buys</h3>\n<p>The second benefit is that by creating this list and letting it age, you learn to spend less on impulse buys, while still being open to making spending decisions that truly enrich your life. True impulse buys won't tempt you to return, since the inconvenience of going back will be stronger than the impulse to buy. The purchases you actually care about will be worth the wait, and allowing yourself to go back for such buys will ensure you don't feel deprived.

But recognizing the time cost of purchases, asking yourself why you're buying, and honoring your impulses by creating a purchase wish list can all help you to pause between your desire and your purchase.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

The problem is that a membership for the summer costs $255, but daily admission is $8 per head, which comes to $32 per outing for the whole family. </p>\n<p>Some summers, we knock out almost 10 visits before the 4th of July rolls around. On others, we're only just getting to the pool for the first or second time as of Labor Day. And it never fails that we pay-per-visit on the years we go all the time, and plunk down the full membership fee on the years we never manage to go.</p>\n<p>So how do you decide if a membership will save you money or simply cost you more? Here are some things to consider.</p>\n<h2>Know your break-even point</h2>\n<p>The first consideration is one most people recognize as an easy way to compare apples to apples. In the case of our local pool, we know that we would need to visit the pool at least eight times over the summer to break even if we purchase the membership. Families in my neighborhood that spend two days a week at the pool every summer will see that they break even within a month of buying the membership.</p>\n<p>When you're trying to determine if you want to pay the full membership price, doing this quick calculation of the break-even point can potentially help you make a decision. Having a break-even point in mind can also spur you to visit more often if you do purchase a membership. It removes one more barrier to entry for dropping by on a lazy Saturday. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/28-free-ways-to-entertain-your-kids-this-summer?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">28 Free Ways to Entertain Your Kids This Summer</a>)</p>\n<h2>Base your decision on facts, not intentions</h2>\n<p>If you know for sure that you'll visit the pool, the science museum, or the zoo often enough that you'll reach that break-even point quickly, then your decision is easy to make. The problem is when you <em>assume</em> that you'll go all the time rather than <em>know</em> you will.</p>\n<p>Your rosy assumptions about how often you'll schlep the whole family to the museum to take advantage of your membership is a form of the restraint bias. This <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-mental-biases-that-are-keeping-you-poor?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cognitive bias</a> is a universal mental quirk that makes us think we're far more likely to do something beneficial for ourselves in the future, forgetting how impulsive we are in the moment. When you're considering buying a membership to a pool or museum, you're not necessarily thinking about how much work it is to get your family out the door and how you may feel more inclined to just hang out in your backyard with the sprinkler on after a long week. </p>\n<p>To make sure you're not basing your membership decision on unrealistic intentions, plan to visit as often as you like, paying per visit each time. If you actually visit the art museum or yoga studio often enough that you believe you'd break even if you bought the membership, then go for it. But if you don't visit again for six months after giving yourself permission to go as often as you like, then you know that a membership is probably not going to save you money.</p>\n<h2>Consider the perks</h2>\n<p>Even with the break-even point in mind, and knowing your actual visiting habits, it can still feel like a toss-up whether it will make more sense to pay-per-visit or invest in a membership. Something that can help you decide is assessing the perks of membership.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>For instance, some pools, gyms, and community centers will offer members a discount on food. If your family doesn't visit the pool every weekend, but always enjoys concessions when you do go, calculating how much the food discount will save you can help you decide if the membership is worth it.</p>\n<p>You might also enjoy free parking, a discount in the gift shop, or even access to members-only services or events by purchasing a membership. These perks can help you determine if the cost of membership is really a good deal.</p>\n<p>Similarly, many museums, aquariums, and zoos offer reciprocity with other institutions across the country. Even if you don't expect to visit the local science museum more than once or twice in the next year, your membership can get you into other museums while you're on vacation or visiting friends or relatives. This can be especially worthwhile if your local institution's membership is relatively inexpensive, and the cost of the day pass at a reciprocal museum is particularly expensive.</p>\n<h2>Membership has its privileges</h2>\n<p>Membership-based businesses benefit when it's difficult to decide if buying a membership is the best financial choice. They make money whether you pay-per-visit and spend more than you would if you'd joined, or you purchase the membership and don't use it enough to break even.</p>\n<p>That said, taking the time to do a little math, knowing your actual usage rather than your intentions for using your membership, and accounting for the money-saving perks that come with the membership can all help you make the best decision for your wallet.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

After all, your paycheck won't automatically move itself into your savings account or hide itself in your <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-reasons-every-millennial-needs-a-roth-ira?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roth IRA</a>. Only <em>you</em> can take the required steps to set aside some of your money, which we all know can be difficult when times are tough.</p>\n<p>But since saving money is crucial if you want to have cash for emergencies, or actually retire one day, you have to try — even when you can't really afford to. While saving money may not be easy (or any fun), here are some ways to get the ball rolling. </p>\n<h2>1. Know where your money is going</h2>\n<p>If you're struggling to save, the first step you should take is figuring out where your money is going. In other words, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-minute-finance-track-your-spending?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">track your spending</a> so you know exactly what you've been buying and how much you're spending on essentials like transportation and food. </p>\n<p>Keeping track of your spending isn't rocket science and, in fact, a simple notepad and pencil will do the trick. You can also find a variety of apps and programs to choose from if you want technology to do part of the grunt work. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-apps-that-make-budgeting-fun-no-really?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Apps That Make Budgeting Fun — No Really!</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Set up direct deposit into savings</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to grow your rainy-day fund involves transferring money to your savings account, but making it automatic. Check if your bank lets you set up automatic transfers, which they probably do. From there, figure out how much you could save each month on payday and set your account up so some of your money moves to savings on its own. </p>\n<p>When you put your deposits on autopilot, saving money becomes effortless. And provided you can keep your hands out of the cookie jar, your money has the potential to grow much faster than you think. </p>\n<h2>3. Do a no-spend challenge</h2>\n<p>Refraining from spending money for a few months might sound awful, but the end result — more cash in your wallet — may make the sacrifice worth it. Start by stopping all non-essential spending for at least two weeks. From there, see if you can ratchet up the timeline to four weeks, six weeks, or more. </p>\n<p>During your no-spend challenge, the goal should be avoiding any spending that isn't absolutely necessary. This means staying away from the mall and all your favorite online stores, but it also means digging deep into your pantry and freezer to eat food you already have. </p>\n<p>Over the weeks (and hopefully months), you should find some extra savings to stash away. And, who knows? You might even wind up with some better spending habits that will leave you ahead for the long haul.

Dump your debt</h2>\n<p>The burden of debt is significant, especially when you consider that 77 percent of American households have an <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">average debt balance of $123,400</a>, according to a Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances.</p>\n<p>With balances that high, it can be difficult to keep up with bills, let alone stash some money away each month. However, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/fastest-way-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">getting rid of your debt</a> can help free up cash you can save later — even if the road out of debt is an arduous one. </p>\n<p>If your goal is getting out of debt, you'll need to find ways to cut your spending. That way, you can allocate more of your income toward debt repayment each month. Another strategy is picking up a side hustle that can help you start saving, and this may be your only option if your budget is so tight there's already nothing to cut. </p>\n<p>Even if you tackle a small chunk of what you owe, the money you free up could be used to build up your savings account significantly.</p>\n<h2>5. Save your spare change</h2>\n<p>Do you remember the old days when people would toss change into a jar? While this savings method may not be anything revolutionary, it can absolutely work. And if you mostly use cash for purchases, you'll have no trouble getting started. </p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>At the end of every day, go through your pockets (or your purse). Any extra coins you have can go into an old coffee can, mason jar, or piggy bank. </p>\n<p>If credit and debit cards are more your style, you still have options to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/everyones-using-spare-change-apps-are-they-really-worth-it?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">save your spare change</a>. Like most things in life, there's an app for that.</p>\n<p>Qapital is a popular app that automatically rounds up your transactions to the nearest dollar and transfers the difference to a separate account. When you spend $5.76, for example, Qapital will move $0.24 to a savings account.</p>\n<p>Over time, your spare change can take on a life of its own. And since you're parting with so little at a time, you probably won't miss it.</p>\n<h2>6. Get a new quote for car insurance</h2>\n<p>Shopping around for lower prices on your regular monthly expenses can help you keep more money in your pocket, and car insurance is a good place to start. If you haven't gotten a new quote for car insurance in a while, going online or making a few phone calls could save you more than you might think.</p>\n<p>As you shop around for a new policy, ask about discounts you might qualify for that could reduce your bill even more. It's possible you could save big on similar coverage just by switching insurers, but discounts for bundling policies, safety equipment you have, or a clear driving record could whittle your bill down even further.</p>\n<h2>7. Cut cable television</h2>\n<p>The cost of cable television is out of control, with some subscribers paying $200 or more per month to watch their favorite shows at home. When you realize that can add up to $2,400 a year, it's easy to see why saving money can be such a problem.</p>\n<p>If living without TV isn't an option, consider subscribing to a cheaper alternative. Netflix offers plans that start at just $8.99 a month, while Hulu will cost you $5.99. Even if you subscribe to both, you're still saving over $2,200 every year by cutting cable.</p>\n<h2>8. Stop shopping online</h2>\n<p>Whether you constantly find yourself tempted by Facebook ads or you like to pass the time browsing on Amazon, online shopping is a surefire way to sabotage your savings goals.</p>\n<p>Unless you're getting an item that you'd typically buy anyway (think: toilet paper or canned green beans), online shopping is probably costing you more than you think. Too often, people browse Amazon out of boredom and wind up spending $50 or $100 on stuff they don't even need.</p>\n<p>If you think you can't afford to start saving money, try uninstalling the shopping apps on your phone. You may find you start saving when you make spending a lot less convenient.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

It's possible to use airline miles for flights that could easily cost thousands of dollars apiece and with enough hotel points, you can book stays at luxury resorts that would typically be beyond your reach.</p>\n<p>Like with most things, however, the devil is in the details when it comes to travel rewards. Not only are there travel-related fees you may need to pay, but there are also hidden travel expenses that can wreck your finances if you aren't aware they exist. </p>\n<p>If you have a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel credit card</a> or two and a big stash of points and miles, it's crucial to know about hidden taxes, fees, and expenses you'll need to plan for before any big trip. Here are the most common offenders to be aware of.</p>\n<h2>1. Government-mandated airline taxes and fees</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/when-airline-miles-arent-worth-the-effort?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cashing in airline miles</a> for a \"free flight\" can seem like a dream come true, but don't forget you'll have to pay government-mandated taxes and fees just like you would if you paid cash for your fare. While airline taxes only amount to $5.60 per person, per leg on domestic flights, you can easily be stuck paying a few hundred bucks or even more to redeem miles for certain international routes.</p>\n<p>To avoid a nasty surprise, know about airline taxes and fees and price them out before you book your trip. Don't let these fees catch you by surprise, and they won't ruin your vacation.</p>\n<h2>2. Fuel surcharges</h2>\n<p>Also note that some airlines tack on huge fuel surcharges on their international award fares. British Airways is famous for doing this on their many routes, but particularly on itineraries that stop at London Heathrow. You may <em>think </em>you're getting ready to score a \"free flight\" to Europe with British Airways (or another airline that partners with British Airways), when suddenly, you're hit with hundreds of dollars in fees.</p>\n<p>There's not much you can do about fuel surcharges, other than shopping around among different airline loyalty programs to find routes with minimal fees. However, this is also an argument for earning flexible rewards that transfer to more than one airline instead of a single airline currency. </p>\n<p>When you have flexible rewards points you can transfer to other airlines or use to book flights with any airline through a travel portal, you can compare several routes and award fares to see how they stack up.</p>\n<h2>3. Parking fees</h2>\n<p>Even if you cash in flexible travel credit or <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-7-best-ways-to-earn-travel-points-and-miles-without-a-credit-card?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hotel loyalty points</a> for a free resort stay, you may be asked to pay for \"extras\" outside your nightly rate. One popular fee people complain about is parking, and especially compulsory valet parking fees.</p>\n<p>If you plan to use hotel points or other travel rewards for a hotel stay and you happen to have your own car or a rental car, make sure to find out ahead of time if parking fees are assessed, and if so, how much they cost.</p>\n<h2>4. Resort fees</h2>\n<p>Hilton Honors is notorious for waiving resort fees on award stays. Plus, World of Hyatt Discoverist members (and those with higher elite status) enjoy waived resort fees on award stays. </p>\n<p>However, not all hotel programs waive their resort fees — even for elite members. Before you book a stay with points with any resort, make sure to find out if they charge a resort fee and if you're required to pay it.</p>\n<h2>5. Checked baggage fees</h2>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-co-branded-airline-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">airline credit cards</a> offer a first checked bag free as a cardholder perk. However, you won't necessarily qualify for a free checked bag if you don't have a card that offers this benefit — even if you used miles for your flight.</p>\n<p>If you don't have a co-branded airline credit card, in fact, it's likely you'll need to pay for any luggage you bring on your trip outside of a carry-on bag and personal item that fits under the seat in front of you. While checked bag fees vary, they will usually set you back around $35 per bag when you fly within the U.S. </p>\n<h2>6. Seat selection fees</h2>\n<p>Keep seat selection fees in mind — particularly if you want to choose your airplane seat ahead of time. Where some airlines will let you select a seat ahead of time without any charge, others — and particularly airlines based outside the United States — charge extra for seat selection up until 24 hours before your flight departs.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Also be careful if you wind up redeeming rewards for a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-avoid-airline-fees-in-basic-economy?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">basic economy fare</a>. Not only will you be asked to pay extra to bring a carry-on bag on the plane with these fares, but you'll have to pay to select a seat, or accept whatever seat is given to you upon check-in.</p>\n<h2>7. Food spending</h2>\n<p>No matter where you're going or what's included, you'll probably need to spend some money on food during your trip. Even if you're visiting an <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/all-inclusive-resorts-you-can-book-for-free-with-points?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all-inclusive resort</a> you've booked with points, you'll need to eat when you're en route to your destination — and your meals may even be at the airport where food is notoriously expensive.</p>\n<p><strong>The bottom line</strong>: Make sure to budget for some meals and snacks during your journey, or you may regret it later.</p>\n<h2>8. Airport parking</h2>\n<p>Driving to the airport? In that case, you'll likely need to pay for airport parking on-site or somewhere in the general area. While long-term airport parking can cost as little as $7 or $8 per day at some airports, covered parking and valet parking can cost $25 per day or a whole lot more.</p>\n<p>You can always take a taxi or call an Uber or Lyft for a ride to the airport to save on parking, but once again, there are costs involved. Have a plan to get to and from the airport so you can budget accordingly.</p>\n<h2>9. Rental car insurance</h2>\n<p>Finally, there's nothing better than renting a car with credit card rewards and enjoying the open road on somebody else's dime. However, you may be asked — or even required — to pay for pricey rental car insurance at the rental counter depending on your travel destination.</p>\n<p>If you're visiting a country where additional insurance is optional, you can usually rely on your own auto insurance to cover you in the event of a wreck, damage, or theft. However, note that some credit cards offer primary rental car coverage for free as a cardholder perk.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

For starters, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel rewards credit cards</a> offer the easiest way to earn rewards on your regular spending, but some of us don't have the 740+ credit scores required to get approved for them. Not only that, but consumers struggling with credit card debt may not want to run out and pick up a rewards credit card — especially since travel credit cards tend to charge high interest rates.</p>\n<p>Now, here's the good news: You can earn travel rewards without a credit card, and some strategies are a lot easier than you think. If you want to earn rewards for travel but can't use credit right now, here are the best options to consider.</p>\n<h2>1. Join airline dining clubs</h2>\n<p>If you dine out often and want to earn airline miles, you should check out airline dining programs from <a href=\"https://skymilesdining.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Delta SkyMiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rapidrewardsdining.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southwest Rapid Rewards</a>, <a href=\"https://aa.rewardsnetwork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American AAdvantage</a>, and more. These dining clubs will award you airline miles simply for signing up and eating at participating restaurants. You can even earn sign-up bonuses of up to 3,000 miles for dining out at least a handful of times within the first 30 days.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that dining clubs are free to use, and if you're going to dine out anyway, you might as well take advantage. At the very least, check out each of the dining clubs for airlines you fly with to see if you like any of the participating restaurants in your area. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-airline-dining-rewards-programs?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everything You Need to Know About Airline Dining Rewards Programs</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Shop through airline shopping portals</h2>\n<p>If you shop online frequently, like most people do, make sure you're clicking through a portal each time you make a purchase. Airlines like United, Alaska, American, and Southwest have their own shopping portals that give you bonus miles for each dollar you spend.</p>\n<p>All you're required to do is log onto your account and \"click through\" to each store's website before you shop for your purchase to qualify. And you don't have to use a credit card to pay for your purchases, either. Instead, you can use other forms of payment like PayPal or debit. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-use-airline-shopping-portals-to-cash-in-on-rewards?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Use Airline Shopping Portals to Cash In On Rewards</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Join airline and hotel loyalty programs for free</h2>\n<p>Make sure you're joining airline and hotel loyalty programs for brands you frequently use. This is especially important if you're booking paid travel. By including your loyalty number on your hotel or airline reservation, you'll earn points or miles for any travel you complete.</p>\n<p>How much can you earn with paid travel? That totally depends on the airline or hotel and their basic earning structure. As an example, Southwest Rapid Rewards currently gives you six points per $1 spent on their basic Wanna Get Away fares, but you can earn 12 miles per $1 spent on their Business Select fares. Delta SkyMiles, on the other hand, currently awards five miles per $1 spent to basic members who book Delta-marketed flights.</p>\n<h2>4. Book all your hotel stays and rental cars through a portal</h2>\n<p>Whenever you book travel, take a moment to think of the ways you could earn additional travel rewards for each dollar you spend. For example, most airlines work with hotel and rental car partners, and they will award you miles in their programs if you book your travel through their website instead of somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Many airline loyalty programs even offer bonus rewards when you book vacation packages and cruises, so make sure to scan your options before you book any type of travel online. With <a href=\"https://www.bookaacruises.com/?reportedLocation=HomePageB1&amp;reportedTitle=&amp;_locale=en_US&amp;utm_medium=partner_site_banner&amp;utm_source=aa-homepage_b&amp;utm_campaign=gen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American AAdvantage Cruises</a>, for example, you can earn up to 10,000 bonus miles per cruise booking. This is a nice perk if you were going to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-score-a-european-cruise-for-1000-or-less?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">book a cruise</a> anyway.</p>\n<h2>5. Check out PointsHound.com and RocketMiles.com</h2>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://www.pointshound.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PointsHound</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rocketmiles.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RocketMiles</a>, since both will award you airline miles in specific airline loyalty programs for each qualifying hotel booking you make.</p>\n<p>PointsHound, for example, promises up to 10,000 miles for some hotel stays and you can choose from over 300,000 hotels and resorts worldwide. You also get the option to choose from popular airlines like Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines, American Airlines, Frontier Airlines, and more.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. Take online surveys</h2>\n<p>Several airlines give their loyal customers the opportunity to earn miles for answering survey questions online. You won't earn a lot of miles with this strategy, but it's still better than nothing. And if you have some time to kill, spending a few hours answering easy survey questions can help you score a few hundred airline miles you can use later.</p>\n<p>Here are a few of the top airline survey portals you should check out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aa.com/i18n/aadvantage-program/miles/partners/financial-and-business.jsp#erewards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Airlines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.opinionmilesclub.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United Airlines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pointsforsurveys.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JetBlue</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.southwest.com/html/rapidrewards/partners/specialty/rewards-for-opinions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southwest Airlines</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7. Watch for special promotions</h2>\n<p>Keep an eye out for special promotions from your favorite airline and hotel loyalty programs. From time to time, you can earn bonus points or miles for sharing a post or hashtag on social media or making a specific purchase.</p>\n<p>The best way to find out about special promotions is signing up for emails from your favorite travel brands and following them on social media. Once you do that, you can watch out for opportunities to earn easy bonus miles that add up over time.</p>\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n<p>If you don't want a credit card or can't qualify for one right now, that doesn't mean you'll never be able to earn travel rewards. As highlighted above, there are quite a few ways to score points and miles if you're willing to do the legwork. But the spoils go to those who put in the effort, so start trying to earn bonus rewards today.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

After all, you ultimately need to settle on a vacation idea most of your family will enjoy — without going over your predetermined budget, of course.</p>\n<p>While camping or renting a condo at the beach can be both frugal and fun, many families look to cruising to satisfy their family's desire for adventure for a price they can afford. Not only are cruises jam-packed with activities for everyone in your crew, but they can be more affordable than you think.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the reasons cruising is such a smart idea for families with kids — and a few ways to whittle down the cost even more.

Kids can (sometimes) cruise free</h2>\n<p>Several cruise lines, including Norwegian and Royal Caribbean, offer \"kids sail free\" promotions that can lead to huge savings. Also, MSC Cruises — which offers insanely affordable cruises worldwide as well as Caribbean cruises out of Miami, Florida — lets <a href=\"https://www.msccruisesusa.com/en-us/Cruise-Deals/Kids-Cruise-Free.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kids cruise free on select itineraries</a> (including most of their Caribbean cruises) all year.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you'll still have to pay taxes and fees for kids who \"cruise free,\" and these usually amount to a few hundred dollars. Still, not having to pay regular cruise fare for your kids can help you cut costs quite a bit.

Score lodging, meals, and entertainment for one low price</h2>\n<p>Cruising includes more than a regular hotel stay. Not only is your cruise lodging included, but you'll have access to around-the-clock entertainment and an endless array of food that's served.</p>\n<p>Make sure to factor in cruise freebies as you budget for your trip. After all, not having to pay for the bulk of your family's meals can free up vacation funds to spend on other aspects of your family vacation.

Free babysitting</h2>\n<p>While cruise ships offer plenty of fun for travelers of all ages, they also offer one perk parents tend to love — free babysitting. Yes, most cruise ship kid's clubs offer supervised play for kids ages four and up. The majority of kid's clubs also offer expansive playrooms, organized activities and crafts, and free time to make new friends.</p>\n<p>Not only do kids love visiting onboard children's clubs, but parents love getting a break. Best of all, this babysitting is free during their regular opening hours.</p>\n<h2>4. You can visit multiple destinations</h2>\n<p>Name another type of vacation where you get to visit several destinations within the span of a week, without having to drive yourself to each spot. Can't come up with anything? We didn't think so.</p>\n<p>One big benefit of cruising is the fact that you can select an itinerary that takes you to several different destinations you want to explore. Better yet, the price of getting from place-to-place is wrapped up in your cruise fare.</p>\n<h2>5. Drive to the cruise port instead of flying</h2>\n<p>Because cruise ports are scattered all around the coasts, it's possible you could drive to a cruise port and avoid the cost of airfare. You could easily save up to $400 per person (or even more) on domestic airfare this way, although you'll have to pay to park your car during your cruise if you go that route.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>If you can't drive to a cruise port — or you simply don't want to — you can also consider earning airline miles to cover your family's flights. <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/best-domestic-frequent-flyer-program-southwest-airlines-rapid-rewards-premier-credit-card?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southwest Airline's co-branded airline credit cards</a> tend to be popular for cruisers since their loyalty program is fare-based and the airline flies to numerous cruise port destinations like New Orleans, Tampa, and Fort Lauderdale. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-affordable-caribbean-cruise-ports-for-families?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Affordable Caribbean Cruise Ports for Families</a>)</p>\n<h2>6. Excursions can be cheap, or free</h2>\n<p>Many cruisers complain about the high cost of ship-based excursions, and their concerns are usually warranted. It's not unusual to see cruise ship excursions that cost well over $100 per person, and those costs can be absurd when you're planning for a family.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of destinations that don't require an organized excursion at all. You can usually disembark the ship and walk around cruise port common areas for free, and you may be able to hop in a quick taxi for a day trip to a beach or a local landmark.</p>\n<p>Don't assume you have to book your excursions through your ship. Instead, do your own research on cruise forums or TripAdvisor.com and look for ways to have a fun day on the cheap.</p>\n<h2>7. Watch out for special promotions</h2>\n<p>If you're keen to cruise with a specific cruise line, you may want to sign up for their newsletter so you can find out first about special promotions and deals. In addition to kids cruise free offers, it's common to see promotions for free drink packages, free onboard internet access, onboard credits, and other special cruise discounts.</p>\n<h2>8. Book early (or late) to save even more</h2>\n<p>Booking your cruise early is often the best way to get access to special promotions, but you also get your pick of available cruise cabins. In fact, it's often suggested to book close to one year before your departure date if you hope to get the lowest pricing and the most perks, along with the exact cabin you want.</p>\n<p>Then again, you can also save big if you book your cruise at the last minute. For example, VacationstoGo.com offers a 90-day ticket that features unsold cruise cabins at up to 82 percent off the retail price.</p>\n<h2>9. Cover your cruise with a travel rewards credit card</h2>\n<p>Finally, don't forget how powerful a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel credit card</a> can be when it comes to reducing your out-of-pocket cruising costs. Not only can you pick up a travel credit card that doles out rewards to cover your cruise in its entirety (or part of your cruise), but you can also use travel rewards for a rental car to get to the cruise port, airfare, and travel incidentals.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

We're not worried about destroying the old plaster (the water is doing a fine job of that on its own). Nor are we concerned that we can't handle the necessary work, since we plan to contract it out.</p>\n<p>No, we're wary of this particular home improvement project because we know how little fixes can balloon into major rehabs when you're not looking.</p>\n<p>Here's how it might go: We'll have to open a wall to find the source of the leak. Once the wall is open, we'll need to add insulation, since our 80-year-old house has very little. Then we'll need to install an attic fan to make the most of the insulation. To make sure the intake for the new attic fan works properly, we'll need to install soffit vents — which will involve cutting holes in our soffits. Next, we're going to need to caulk and repaint them to make sure there are no further leaks.</p>\n<p>And these are just the potential repairs we can anticipate. Who knows what kinds of problems we'll uncover once walls are open and repair personnel are hired? This is how fixing a single leak could end up costing tens of thousands of dollars, plus all the hours we'd rather spend watching Netflix.</p>\n<p>Engaging in necessary acts of home improvement doesn't have to bust your budget, or take up all of your time. Here's what you need to know about keeping your home improvement projects from wrecking your budget. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/10-things-to-know-before-you-start-a-home-improvement-project?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 Things to Know Before You Start a Home Improvement Project</a>)</p>\n<h2>Beware of scope creep</h2>\n<p>\"Scope creep\" is a useful term that comes from the world of project management. It describes the phenomenon where the work required for a project continues to grow after the project has begun.</p>\n<p>There are three main reasons why scope creep runs rampant in <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/9-modern-home-improvements-that-add-thousands-to-your-listing?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home improvement projects</a>:</p>\n<h3>Unanticipated repair needs</h3>\n<p>This is when you have no idea there's an issue that you'll need to take care of until after you get started on a project. For instance, let's say you're stripping the paint off of some floor molding to get it to match the hardwood. But as you work, you discover that the previous owners patched and painted the molding to cover termite damage. You can leave the job half-done, repaint what you've stripped to try to match the paint you've been stripping off, or pay to have all of your molding replaced.</p>\n<h3>The 'while-we're-at-it' effect</h3>\n<p>This happens when you feel like you should take the opportunity to make repairs you know you'll want in the future. The while-we're-at-it effect is the reason why my husband and I are playing chicken with the leak in our dining room. We know that getting started on the repair will mean opening ourselves to a number of other projects we want to take on, just not right now.</p>\n<h3>DIY incompetence</h3>\n<p>Sometimes a project's scope increases because of your own mistakes, and this is especially common with easy-to-fix problems. Let's say you're replacing the washer on a leaky bathroom faucet. This is an easy repair that pretty much any homeowner can handle solo. But you find corrosion once you've taken apart the faucet, so you decide to replace the old faucet with a new one. And in the process of removing the corroded faucet, you manage to break the pipe behind the wall.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a quick fix that costs a few bucks and an hour of your time has ballooned into a major home repair headache.</p>\n<h2>Protecting your budget</h2>\n<p>So how do you protect yourself, your budget, and your time from unexpected problems? Unfortunately, there's no way to completely eradicate the issue of scope creep in your home projects. However, there are some rules you can follow to keep the worst excesses of scope creep at bay.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Start with a plan</h3>\n<p>While no plan survives its first contact with reality, you're going to have a far easier time sticking to the plan you have than the one you don't. Before a single hammer is swung, a single paint scraper is wielded, or a single screw is driven, decide exactly what you plan to do with your project. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/10-simple-household-repairs-every-frugal-person-should-master?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 Simple Household Repairs Every Frugal Person Should Master</a>)</p>\n<h3>Add 15 to 20 percent to every budget estimate</h3>\n<p>Planning to spend every single penny that you can afford on your project may be optimistic, but it's not good budgeting. Assume that any estimate you receive (or create, if you are DIYing) is the best-case scenario, and mentally add 15 to 20 percent to the total to see if the project is still affordable for you.</p>\n<h3>Know which problems are urgent and which are just ugly</h3>\n<p>A problem with foundation, structure, plumbing, wiring, heating, the roof, or mold is something you need to take care of right away. These issues can have long-term and serious impacts on your home if they're left unfixed. Uncovering such a problem will necessarily add to the cost of your project, but it's money you have to spend to protect yourself and your home. Problems outside those major areas may be unpleasant, but you can wait to fix them while you save up more money. It may not be fun to have a plastic tarp instead of the elegant cabinet doors you wanted in your kitchen, but it won't hurt you or your home's resale value to live with it temporarily.</p>\n<h3>Be willing to hit pause</h3>\n<p>Once you realize that your project is bigger than you planned, it can be tough to stop and assess what you'll need for the next part of the project. But pausing in the middle of a project can save you a great deal of heartache. This can give you the chance to research the best way to deal with your project as it currently stands. You can live with a little chaos while you take stock of what you need.</p>\n<h2>Scope creep doesn't have to bust your budget</h2>\n<p>Home projects will always have surprises that can potentially hurt a budget. However, thinking through what you want to accomplish before you start, adding some contingency money to your budget, understanding which problems are urgent and which are not, and a willingness to take your time to fix unexpected issues can all help you keep your project from spiraling out of control.</p>\n<p>Which means it's probably time for us to do something about that leak in the dining room...</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

You've done your due diligence in preparing to put it on the market. You've meticulously staged it and strategically scheduled open houses. You've given the listing agent the green light to list it. And amazingly, your very first showing generates multiple offers. Sounds like a homeowner's dream problem, right?</p>\n<p>In today's real estate climate, bidding wars are something more and more home sellers are having to navigate. While this is a great problem to have, multiple offers could muddy the waters and confuse the process of accepting an offer and closing the deal. Making the wrong choice could cost you time, stress, and thousands of dollars in lost profits.</p>\n<p>Sifting through multiple competing offers that all seem similar can be a daunting process. However, with the right perspective and the ability to detect small differences in each offer, you can make the right decision and quickly close on your home. Here are four things that will help you sift through multiple offers and pick the best one. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-sell-your-home-in-a-sellers-market?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Sell Your Home in a Seller's Market</a>)</p>\n<h2>Understand the process</h2>\n<p>It's important that you understand the homebuying process from a seller's perspective. Sure, you've been through the process, but it was as a buyer and not a seller. Changing your perspective and understanding the potential roadblocks at each stage is crucial.</p>\n<p>If you're using an agent or broker to assist with the sale of your home, it's still your responsibility to understand and actively participate in the process. While agents are great advisors and have a wealth of knowledge, the decision on which offer to select is ultimately yours. It's also important to understand that the real estate agent is not an objective source of information. He or she benefits from your profit — which can work for or against you. Make sure to ask questions throughout the process. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-questions-to-ask-before-selling-your-house?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 Questions to Ask Before Selling Your House</a>)</p>\n<h2>Prioritize your needs</h2>\n<p>Before listing your home, you should know what your priorities are for selling. While getting the most money may seem like it <em>should</em> be the ultimate end goal, the highest offer may not be the best offer. For example, if you're looking to purchase another home once your current home is sold, the closing date becomes a much bigger priority. This is especially true if you've already found a home you want to make an offer on. Or, you may be trying to stave off foreclosing or avoid a short sale. In that case, the bottom line becomes extremely important.</p>\n<p>Another example may be that you were offered your dream job in another location and you've decided to sell instead of renting your current place. The closing process becomes extremely important. Certain types of financing and mortgages can dramatically lengthen the time it takes to close, and they can also add additional contingencies that don't accompany conventional loan financing.</p>\n<p>Establishing non-negotiables is another thing you should do before putting your house on the market. Keep in mind though, at some point everything becomes negotiable. However, you do want to ensure your agent understands your needs and the things you are unwilling to compromise on. Having a list of priorities can help you eliminate certain offers immediately and will allow the best offers to organically rise to the surface. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-sell-a-home-without-a-traditional-agent?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Sell a Home Without a Traditional Agent</a>)</p>\n<h2>Create a uniform review process</h2>\n<p>Creating a process for reviewing and assessing offers will save you so much time and energy. Once you've established your priorities and non-negotiables, it's easy to set parameters on the types of financing, time to close, and contingencies you're willing to consider. It's also smart to set a deadline for accepting offers. You can set a hard date cutoff when you reach a certain number of offers. Once you've gotten those things established, the process gets much easier and it'll help you not feel overwhelmed by it all.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>From there, you may want to establish criteria for assessing offers and a ranking system that will help you further narrow things down. For example, you may want to assign a lower priority rating or eliminate offers from those who are merely prequalified versus those who are pre-approved for finances. Other factors you may want to use to vet offers are loan types (conventional versus VA, FHA, etc.), request for assistance with closing costs, down payment (or lack of), and if the offer is contingent upon the sale of another property. A good rule of thumb when sifting through offers is: the fewer contingencies, the better. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-unexpected-costs-of-selling-a-home?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8 Unexpected Costs of Selling a Home</a>)</p>\n<h2>Do the math</h2>\n<p>While you're in the process of categorizing, reviewing, and assessing offers, it's important to calculate your total net profit for each serious offer. For example, if a potential buyer is offering the full asking price but has no down payment, is asking for $3,000 in closing costs, and requests a closing date three months from the date of contract, you definitely want to pause and do the math. If you have another buyer who offers $1,500 less than the asking price, but doesn't request any closing costs and can close in 45 days, that deal is far more profitable than the first.</p>\n<p>Ensuring that you do the math and find the offer that is not only the most profitable, but the most beneficial to you is key. Finding a buyer who is flexible enough to close quickly but allows you to stay in the house and pay them rent for two months while you find another place is so much more valuable than an extra $2,000 profit. Make sure you take time to pause and view each offer from multiple perspectives.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

But thanks to changes in the financial industry, ordinary, non-wealthy people can now access almost all of these services, if they're willing to do a bit of the legwork themselves.</p>\n<p>The sorts of services that private banks provide fall into four general categories: Banking services, investment services, advisory services, and perqs. Of course, they also come at a price, which you can largely avoid if you roll your own. </p>\n<h2>Banking services</h2>\n<p>One thing that private banks provide are standard banking services. They receive your deposits, process your payments, transfer your money, offer loans, etc. Your ordinary non-private bank will do all of these things as well, but in the old days, they expected you to show up in-person at the bank. Since you can now do these things online, rolling your own private-bank equivalent is easy.</p>\n<p>Let's say you're traveling abroad, meet someone lovely that you'd like to spend more time with, and decide to extend your travels. In the old days, a private banker could really help with logistics — get someone to collect your mail, sort through it to find any checks or bills you'd received, and get them deposited or paid as the case may be. If incoming checks didn't quite cover your new travel expenses, they could also float you a quick loan. They could also get local currency delivered to you.</p>\n<p>But now, handling these sorts of affairs is much easier for people to do on their own. Your incoming funds are direct deposited to your account. Your bills are set to be paid automatically, or you can can pay them online. Local currency is as close as the nearest ATM.</p>\n<p>Loans, in particular, used to be a major competitive advantage for private bankers. Because your private banker had intimate knowledge of the state of your finances, they were uniquely positioned to be able to immediately approve a loan — either a short-term loan, or a longer-term loan to buy a third home or restructure your business. Now every credit card will allow you to take a cash advance at least as large as a prudent banker would allow. (A very expensive loan, mind you, but one that'll be approved faster than even a private banker could.)</p>\n<h2>Investing services</h2>\n<p>Private banks have an investment arm. The fee they charge is a fraction of your assets under management, but the fee scales down as you have more to invest.</p>\n<p>Of course, most banks have investment options nowadays, and every brokerage can provide banking services. They will also manage your money for a fraction of the assets under management. Or, for a <em>much smaller</em> fraction of the money under management, you can create your own investment portfolio. Put your money into low-cost mutual funds or <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-ways-to-invest-like-a-pro-no-financial-adviser-required?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buy some ETFs</a> in your brokerage account and you'll likely do as well in the market as the rich guy whose private banker has hooked him up with a top investment adviser. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-one-mediocre-investor-prospered-after-the-market-crash?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How One Mediocre Investor Prospered After the Market Crash</a>)</p>\n<h2>Advising services</h2>\n<p>Besides actual banking services, a private banker can connect you with all sorts of professionals that the wealthy need: tax accountants, estate planners, investment managers, and so on. If you're really wealthy, it can make sense to wrap all these advisers together with a private banker.</p>\n<p>But if you're not that wealthy, you probably don't need your banker to pull everything together, as long as you're willing to do the leg work yourself. It's not that hard to find a good tax guy or accountant, and a lawyer who can write a will or a trust. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-estate-planning-questions-everyone-should-ask?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Estate Planning Questions Everyone Should Ask</a>)</p>\n<h2>Perqs</h2>\n<p>This is where the movie version of the private banker meets real life. One category of perqs is called concierge services. Your private banker can hook you up with hard-to-get tickets, invitations to exclusive events, make complicated travel arrangements, and so on. This category is so popular these days that just about everybody is offering it — in particular, all the upscale credit cards have a concierge service. They've started outsourcing the work to firms that specialize in it — something that's an option for you as well.</p>\n<p>It's probably cheaper to hire a personal assistant to do these things for you, and of course <em>much</em> cheaper to do it yourself.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Legitimate needs</h2>\n<p>If you're really rich — investable assets in excess of $25 million, let's say — there will be private bankers interested in your business, and they may be able to provide services that are worth the $125,000 or more they're likely to cost each year.</p>\n<p>For example, restructuring a multi-million dollar business so that Dad can partially cash out while passing the rest of the business on to his kids is likely to require a whole range of experts in accounting, taxes, and estate planning, plus a banker. A private banker is probably your best entryway into getting services of that sort.</p>\n<p>Or let's say you're buying a private jet. Even if you're genuinely rich enough to afford one, you probably don't have all that money sitting around in cash. Your private banker will be pleased to produce a custom financing package based on intimate knowledge of what cash you do have and what investment transactions are already in the works. They'll also handle the payment and make a conference room available for you and the seller to finalize the transaction.</p>\n<p>Short of that sort of wealth and complexity, you can almost certainly get the services you need for much less than what a private banker would charge (if they'd even take your business). (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-5-millennial-money-apps-everyone-should-use?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 5 Millennial Money Apps Everyone Should Use</a>)</p>\n<h2>My advice</h2>\n<p>Banking services — even the sorts that used to be specialized for rich people — are routinely available to ordinary people at very reasonable prices, thanks to innovation and the internet. Because banks now all own brokerage firms and brokerage firms now all own banks, you can go either way when you pick the firm where you'll roll your own private bank. The advantage of a brokerage firm is that you can use your investments as collateral for a loan — the interest rate is typically half to a third of what a cash advance on a credit card would cost you. The advantage of a bank is that they have local offices where you can get cash, talk to a banker, use their conference room to close a deal, etc.</p>\n<p>You want to avoid money center banks and major regional banks — they're only interested in earning million-dollar fees for putting together billion-dollar deals. What you want is a bank one step down in size. (My bank isn't in the top 100 biggest banks, but it is in the top 200.) Banks that size, especially ones with a local connection, will have bankers who are actually interested in providing services to individual people, rather than just to major corporations. And a banker who will provide personal service can be just as good as a private banker.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

You likely did painstaking research on each company and carefully considered loan offers before deciding on one.</p>\n<p>Despite all that hard work, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-ways-to-vet-your-mortgage-lender?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your mortgage servicer</a> — the company that collects your monthly payments — can change. And there's not much you can do about it. If you receive a notice that your mortgage has been sold to a new servicer, here's what you need to know about the transition.</p>\n<h2>Why mortgages sometimes change hands</h2>\n<p>It's quite common for mortgages to be sold. One day, you might find a letter in the mailbox from your mortgage servicer stating that your mortgage has been sold. Mortgages servicers sell loans for several different reasons, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To raise capital: </strong>Because mortgages are often repaid over the course of decades, loan servicers would be strapped for cash if they tried to manage every mortgage themselves. Instead, they bundle a group of them together and sell them to other servicers or investment companies to raise capital.<br>\n     </li>\n<li><strong>The company is closing: </strong>Some loan servicers close, or merge with other servicers. To complete the transition, they sell the current mortgages to other servicers. <br>\n     </li>\n<li><strong>They're switching their focus: </strong>When a company decides to focus on another area of business, such as commercial real estate, they'll sell off their existing portfolio.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your loan servicer sells your mortgage, it's nothing personal against you. It doesn't say anything about you or the home you bought. It's simply a business decision.</p>\n<h2>How to handle the transition</h2>\n<p>Here's how to handle your mortgage being sold to a new servicer.</p>\n<h3>1. Pay attention to notices</h3>\n<p>Many people don't pay enough attention to their mail. They'll skim through it and toss letters or notices from companies they don't recognize. However, that's a big mistake. If you have any type of debt, including mortgages or student loans, your loan servicer will typically communicate solely through the mail. If you're not careful, you could miss out on important notifications.</p>\n<p>Get in the habit of opening every piece of mail that arrives to ensure you have the latest information on your mortgage and other financial accounts.</p>\n<h3>2. Check your credit report</h3>\n<p>It's possible to miss a notice. You could accidentally toss a letter from your loan servicer, or it could even be lost in the mail.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>That's why it's so important to check your credit report on a regular basis. Your credit report lists all of your current and past debt, including your mortgage. It lists who you currently owe money to, as well. By checking it every four months — you can access a free credit report from each of the three credit bureaus every year — you can see if your loan servicer changed. Check your credit report for free at AnnualCreditReport.com.

Confirm with your original servicer</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, mortgage scams are common. If you get a notice saying that your mortgage has been sold to a new loan servicer, check with your original servicer by calling them directly before sending in payments to the new one. By double-checking, you can eliminate the risk of getting scammed and giving a fraudulent company your money. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/why-you-should-call-your-mortgage-lender-every-year?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why You Should Call Your Mortgage Lender Every Year</a>)</p>\n<h3>4. Keep up with your payments</h3>\n<p>Your notice should detail when the transition is finalized and who you need to make payments to going forward. During the transition, it's important to keep making payments to your old servicer until the loans officially transfer over, or your credit score could drop. If you're unsure about who to make payments to, contact your new loan servicer.

Maintain excellent records</h3>\n<p>Loan transitions can be overwhelming, so keep receipts of all your payments. And if you speak to a representative from your loan servicer, keep notes on the date, time, and the name of the person you spoke with in case there are any problems.</p>\n<h2>What to expect from the new company</h2>\n<p>Although your loan can be sold at any time without your consent, a sale doesn't change the terms of your loan. Your new company can't reduce your repayment term, for instance, or adjust your monthly payment. The only difference you'll notice is the name of the company you write on your checks.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

While this is a very exciting time for your teen, you also don't want them to go into massive debt chasing their dreams.</p>\n<p>Student loan debt is running rampant today. Your teen might see student loans as an easy way to go to school without worrying about financial costs, but in reality, a heavy debt load can get in the way of their post-graduation dreams. Here's how to help your teen see the big financial picture.</p>\n<h2>Address scary student loan stats</h2>\n<p>According to a 2016 study by Citizens Bank, millennial graduates are spending almost <a href=\"http://investor.citizensbank.com/about-us/newsroom/latest-news/2016/2016-04-07-140336028.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">one-fifth of their income</a> (18 percent) on loan repayment. That means that graduates are well into their 40s before they even see the light at the end of the student loan debt tunnel.</p>\n<p>Not only are graduates paying more money towards loans, but they're also having to delay life milestones like weddings and buying a house. Fifty-four percent of millennials have said they have limited their travel, and 40 percent have limited the amount they can spend on rent or mortgage payments.</p>\n<p>Sit down with your teen and ask them about their future. Do they see themselves spending 20 years paying off debt, or would they rather spend that money on a new car, a wedding, or their first house? Also ask them if they want to be forced into taking a higher paying job that they hate just so they can pay back their student loans. When you saddle yourself with debt before graduation, you limit how much freedom you have when you enter the job field.</p>\n<p>It is also good to remind your kid that debt does not go away. Even if they have no money to pay for it, they cannot declare bankruptcy and expect their student loan to miraculously disappear. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-manage-student-loans-on-a-low-income?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Manage Student Loans On a Low Income</a>)</p>\n<h2>Start with smart financial decisions</h2>\n<p>Once your teen understands how heavy student loan debt can be, they'll know they need to make other money moves in order to pay for college. They can apply for scholarships, and applying for FAFSA can make them eligible for financial aid and also school-sponsored scholarships. Encourage them to apply for scholarships regularly — as if it were their part-time job — because even a $1,000 scholarship will be highly beneficial.</p>\n<p>Encourage them to also raise money through part-time jobs and saving birthday money. Every little bit helps, especially when they're repaying student loan debt while still in college. Attending community college first can also reduce the student loan burden by half.</p>\n<p>If they don't <em>need</em> to take on maximum debt, then why should they? Along with going to community college first, they can test out of classes that they are already experts in, such as freshman English and math courses. This will save time and money.</p>\n<p>There are also many <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/these-17-companies-will-help-you-repay-your-student-loan?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">jobs that offer tuition assistance</a> that are available to college students. These jobs may only offer $500 reimbursement per semester, but it's still something.</p>\n<h2>Stick with federal loans</h2>\n<p>There's a huge difference between federal loans and private loans. Federal student loans have better repayment options, lower interest rates, and they're more forgiving when it comes to job loss and disability.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Even if your teen makes minimum wage after graduation, they can apply for income-driven repayment programs through federal loans and still be able to make payments. Federal loans can also come with forgiveness programs that forgive remaining debt after so many years of on-time payments, or that forgive debt for working in public service.

Make sure they know exactly what you'll be paying for. If you're not going to be paying for their loans, or car, or insurance, let them know so they know how to budget correctly.</p>\n<p>If you do want to help your child with student loan debt, consider paying off some of the payments while they're still in college. Even paying $50 a month towards their loan while they're in school will help significantly.

If possible, they should live at home and live frugally. They don't need to buy a new laptop or make rent payments with this money. Remind them that every dollar borrowed is a dollar plus interest they have to repay after graduation.</p>\n<h2>Make payments in college</h2>\n<p>Even though your teen will have a grace period of up to six months after graduation to start paying back student loans, that doesn't mean you can't start making payments while they’re still in school. This is especially helpful if they have unsubsidized federal loans, since this type of loan accrues interest while the student is in school, during the grace period, and during any forbearance.</p>\n<p>Remind them that any amount of repayment is too little while they're in school. Set regular minimum payments to occur each week, even if it's just $10 to $20. This might mean that your teen needs to eat out less or skip a movie, but it will be worth it once they graduate.

However, shifts in cultural norms and value systems are challenging the notion that owning a home means you've \"arrived.\" Don't get it twisted, consumerism in America is at an all-time high, but more people are evaluating what really makes them happy. And the more they search, the more they are finding that happiness isn't necessarily found in the house with the white picket fence.</p>\n<p>Buying a home can be a great investment if done strategically. It's also a huge commitment, and can financially ruin you if things go sideways. Deciding if buying a home is the right move for you can be tricky. There are a lot of unknowns, but one of the most important factors to consider is your career. Here's how buying a house could affect your career path.</p>\n<h2>Your job options are more limited</h2>\n<p>When you buy a home, you put down roots. Detaching from a rental is so much easier than trying to get out from under a home you've purchased. Most rental agreements build in an early exit component. Leaving before your lease is up is expensive, but it's a lot cheaper and easier than defaulting on a mortgage. Once you pay the fee for breaking the lease — you're done. There are very few repercussions as long as you honor the agreement.</p>\n<p>It's hard to be ambitious and chase your dreams when you are tied to a home in a particular area — especially if that home is in a rural location far from the city. If you're career-focused and driven, home ownership may not be right for you at this moment.</p>\n<h3>Job transfers get trickier</h3>\n<p>If you don't like the neighborhood in which you rent a home or apartment, if you're interested in changing jobs within the same area, or just want a shorter commute, you can remedy these issues easily as a renter. Most rental agreements range from six months to two years, versus the typical 30-year home mortgage. This is especially important in today's job climate. Large companies are downsizing from large corporate headquarters to smaller satellite offices in multiple areas. If you are transferred to a different area — depending on the new location — you are faced with having to decide between a longer commute, frequent travel, relocating, or finding a new job. Handling a job transfer is difficult as it is, but adding a home to the mix really muddies the water.</p>\n<h3>Relocating can turn into a nightmare</h3>\n<p>The internet has revolutionized how we find employment. Let's say you're looking for a position and you find your dream job using a virtual job board. You meet all the job requirements. You have the necessary experience and expertise to fill the role. The pay is <em>decent</em>. And it's the perfect next step in your career. You interview for the position and you're offered a job running a division in Albany, New York. However, you live in Yuma, Arizona. Working remotely is not an option. And you purchased your first home 18 months ago. What do you do?</p>\n<p>If you're in a profession that is transient by nature, you want to think long and hard before purchasing a home. <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/buying-a-house-heres-where-to-keep-your-down-payment?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buying a home</a> is all about timing. Just because you can afford a home doesn't mean you should buy it. The hassle of buying and selling can wreak havoc on your finances if you aren't careful.</p>\n<h2>Investing the down payment could pay off more</h2>\n<p>Many people still consider homeownership to be a good long-term investment. However, the 2008 housing crisis showed the ugly side of homeownership as an investment. Owning a home can be a great way to invest some of your money — but it shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a solid long-term investment. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/heres-why-your-house-is-not-an-investment?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stop Thinking of Your House as an Investment</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>A lot of factors causing a home's value to either appreciate or depreciate are out of the hands of the buyer. Just because a house is cute, has great curb appeal, and an open floor plan doesn't guarantee that it will hold its value and appreciate over time. You have to consider the neighborhood, natural disasters, city construction, future development plans, the presence and strength of a homeowner's association (HOA), and a host of other factors.</p>\n<p>Consider taking the money you intend to use as a down payment and investing it in stocks or mutual funds. The first rule of investing is to diversify, and spreading the money over several solid traditional investments may be a better bet long-term than sinking it all into a personal property. Also, traditional investments don't negatively impact your career. If you move, change careers, or go into business for yourself, you continue earning interest on what you've invested.</p>\n<h2>It can make you too comfortable</h2>\n<p>Home ownership is more mental and emotional than it is financial, and how you think and process your feelings directly impacts your career and financial decisions. Once you establish roots via homeownership, it can become very hard to uproot. For many, a home becomes a symbol of safety, security, and love, and it provides a sense of belonging. Everyone wants those things.</p>\n<p>Owning a home can kill your drive and make you stay in a dead-end job longer than you should. Rather than chasing other opportunities, you may find yourself becoming more and more risk adverse, because the home gives you a reason to stay put. You'll slowly begin to lose that hunger and tenacity that makes you strive for success. Being able to take calculated career risks, such as quitting a dead-end job, starting your own business, or relocating to take a better job are what keeps your career alive and thriving.

But do your homework, and consider the timing of your purchase. Understand that every decision has consequences. Buying a home could impact your career goals, coax you into compromising your professional vision, and slow or hinder your success.

Being \"underwater\" is when you owe more on your mortgage loan than your home is worth.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are times when homeowners have no choice. Your employer might transfer you to a new job across the country. Or your home might be too small for a growing family. If you're in this situation, the odds are high that you'll have to write a check to your lender once your home sale closes. But you might be able to reduce the amount you owe by setting the right asking price and staging your home so that it looks its very best. Here's how to sell your home when you're underwater on your mortgage. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/why-you-should-call-your-mortgage-lender-every-year?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Why You Should Call Your Mortgage Lender Every Year</a>)</p>\n<h2>The challenge</h2>\n<p>Why is selling a home with negative equity such a financial hit? Instead of making money on your home sale, you'll lose it.</p>\n<p>Say you owe $200,000 on your mortgage, but your home is worth only $180,000. You'll struggle to sell your home for more than that $180,000 value. And even if you do sell at that figure, you'll still owe your lender $20,000 after you close your sale. This means you'll have to write your lender a check for $20,000 at closing. That's not the outcome any home seller wants.</p>\n<h2>Wait to sell</h2>\n<p>What if you are underwater on your mortgage? The best advice is to hold off on selling your home, if possible. That way, you can hope that your home gains value — hopefully enough so you no longer have negative equity.</p>\n<p>You can also wait until you make enough monthly mortgage payments so you no longer owe more on your home loan than it's worth. If you can send extra money to your lender to be applied directly to reducing your loan's principal balance, you might be able to build equity at a faster pace.</p>\n<h2>It's becoming less and less common</h2>\n<p>The good news is that the number of homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages is falling, compared to what it was a few years ago. CoreLogic reported that in the first quarter of 2018, the number of <a href=\"https://www.corelogic.com/news/corelogic-reports-home-equity-gains-topped-1-trillion-in-the-first-quarter-of-2018.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">homes with negative equity had fallen 3 percent</a> to under 2.5 million, which represents 4.7 percent of all properties with a mortgage.</p>\n<h2>How to set the right asking price</h2>\n<p>If you have no choice but to sell, the key is to set the right asking price for your property. If you're underwater, you might want to set an asking price that's higher than what the market says your home is worth. Resist this temptation.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Buyers know what a home is worth today. If you set your asking price too high, most will pass your home by, looking at other properties instead. You can't force buyers to pay more for your home because you're underwater, because buyers don't care what you originally paid for your home.</p>\n<p>You need to set an asking price that's fair, but also the highest possible amount you can sell it for. The best way to find this price is to work with a real estate agent who is familiar with your neighborhood. They can help you set an asking price that draws the biggest number of potential buyers, increasing your odds of selling your home for the highest price.

But investing in a home stager can pay off. A stager will rearrange your furniture and home dÃ©cor so that your home looks more spacious, bright, and airy. This will help your home make a strong first impression on buyers. You want buyers to be excited about your home and to make offers that are close to your listing price.

Here's How to Let Go</a>)</p>\n<h2>Make all necessary repairs</h2>\n<p>In order to sell your home, you'll have to repair any broken appliances, torn carpets, dinged walls, or stuck windows. You can't list your home with any defects if you expect buyers to pay top dollar for it. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/9-modern-home-improvements-that-add-thousands-to-your-listing?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">9 Modern Home Improvements That Add Thousands to Your Listing</a>)</p>\n<h2>Don't forget the outside</h2>\n<p>Spend time on your home's exterior, too. Make sure the lawn is neatly trimmed, all weeds are pulled, and you add pops of color with some bright plants. You want buyers to be excited when they pull up. If they see a well-maintained and inviting exterior, they'll be more eager to tour the inside of your home.</p>\n<p>The key here is to squeeze the highest possible offer out of buyers. To do that, your home must be in top condition, both inside and out.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

That's a 6% bump from the year before, notes Student Loan Hero. Collective student loan debt nationwide is also up to $1.48 trillion across 44 million borrowers. With stats like these, it's no wonder students are struggling to repay their loans and defaulting at record pace. But what's a student to do?</p>\n<p>You can stick with the program and make regular monthly payments on your current loans until they're gone, for starters. You can also sign up for an income-driven repayment plan that lets you pay a percentage of your \"discretionary income\" for 20-25 years before forgiving your loans. Or, you can sign up for an employment-related forgiveness program such as <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher\" target=\"_blank\">Teacher Loan Forgiveness</a> and <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service/questions\" target=\"_blank\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Refinance options for student loans</h2>\n<p>Some students even refinance their student loans — usually to secure a lower interest rate or lower monthly payment. There are notable disadvantages for doing so, however. For starters, you lose federal protections such as access to income-driven programs, and forbearance when you refinance federal student loans with a private lender.</p>\n<p>Interest rates on federal loans tend to be fixed while private loans tend to be variable, and this could pose a problem in a rising interest rate environment. Finally, private student loans are never subsidized whereas certain federal loans allow the federal government to pay the interest on your loans while you are in school on at least a half-time basis.</p>\n<p>If you want to stick with federal loans, you can refinance your federal student loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan. However, doing so won't save you any money. That's because this new loan will use the weighted average of your previous student loans as its new interest rate.

The reason is simple: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Balance transfer cards</a> come with 0% APR for anywhere from nine to 21 months, which means indebted borrowers could pay down their loans with <em>no interest </em>during that time.</p>\n<p>According to Michael Lux, an attorney who has spent five years advocating for student loan borrowers at The Student Loan Sherpa, this is rarely a good idea, even though he could see it working out in \"very limited circumstances.\"</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Things to consider before consolidating student loans with a balance transfer card:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your student loan lender may not allow you to make payments or transfer a balance to a credit card<strong>. </strong>However, several banks let you transfer a balance from student lenders. You'll have to check.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You lose federal protections. Like with refinancing federal student loans with a private lender, you lose federal protections like deferment, forbearance, and access to income-driven repayment when you refinance federal loans with a balance transfer card.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may pay higher interest rates over the long-term. While balance transfer cards come with 0% introductory offers, these offers don't last forever. The average interest rate on all credit cards is over 17% right now, which is a lot higher than the ongoing fixed rate on federal loans.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are fees involved. Some balance transfer cards charge a fee equal to 3% - 5% of your balance upfront. This works out to $300 to $500 for every $10,000 you transfer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It's risky. Student Loan expert Ben Luthi of Student Loan Hero says pursuing a balance transfer offer to save money on interest could leave you worse off if you don't pay down your balance before the offer ends. \"The chance of using a 0% APR promotion is enticing, but if something goes wrong, you could end up in a bad situation financially,\" he said. Also, missing a payment during your card's 0% introductory period could mean losing your 0% APR promotion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When it makes sense to use a balance transfer card</h2>\n<p>While there's risk involved in transferring a student loan to a balance transfer card, it can make sense in very select circumstances. For example, it could make sense if you're down to your final $10,000 in student loan debt and fully committed to paying $555 per month to have it paid off within the 18 months you get 0% APR.</p>\n<p>Another time transferring student loans to a balance transfer card can make sense is if someone is expecting a windfall and wants to save on interest in the meantime. \"This move could work for someone who will be getting a large bonus at work in nine months,\" said Lux.</p>\n<p>Another example is if a borrower has a CD or bond that will mature at a set date and a balance transfer card can be used to pay off the student loan while the student awaits their money.</p>\n<p>Still, it's not so clear if you're paying a balance transfer fee, says Luthi. If your balance is small, say just a few thousand dollars, savings resulting from the 0% APR offer may not even outweigh the balance transfer fee. For this reason, you should run the math to see if transferring a balance will actually save you money before you pull the trigger.</p>\n<h2>Should you do it?</h2>\n<p>While there are certain situations where a balance transfer card can be used to save money or pay down student loans faster, this is usually a losing proposition. The fact remains that these cards offer 0% APR for a limited time, and after that, you'll pay the regular interest rate. Since federal student loans offer low fixed rates, paying student loans at a card's regular interest rate can cost you <em>a lot</em> more over time — even after accounting for money saved during the initial 0% period.</p>\n<p>If you do decide to refinance your student loans, you're better off going with a private lender who can offer competitive interest rates and loan terms.

After all, does the buyer really need to know about that ant problem you get in the summer months, or the fight you're having with your cranky neighbor?</p>\n<p>Well, yes, they do. Hiding any kind of problem that will cost the new owners time and money to fix, or make them regret buying the house, could land you in hot water. You may even be sued for substantial damages. Here are some of the biggest offenders. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-things-buyers-will-hate-about-your-house?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Things Buyers Will Hate About Your House</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. A horrific human tragedy</h2>\n<p>There is a certain stigma that attaches to a property after something terrible happens, and that stigma can affect the home's value. Any events deemed \"psychologically damaging\" — such as a high-profile murder — may legally need to be disclosed when selling a home. The specifics will depend largely on your state's laws.</p>\n<p>In California, for example, any kind of death that happened in the home, with the exception of AIDS-related death, must be disclosed if it happened within three years of the sale date. And should the buyer ask if there was a death, suicide, or violent crime at the property, in most states you are legally required to answer truthfully.</p>\n<h2>2. Any asbestos in the structure</h2>\n<p>Once upon a time, asbestos was a staple in home construction. Its fire retardant properties, combined with excellent sound absorption and insulation, made it a useful material. This was until, of course, it was discovered that airborne asbestos particles can cause lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.</p>\n<p>Asbestos is costly and dangerous to remove, and as a seller, you typically have two choices: get rid of it through a specialized firm, or disclose it and tell the new owners it's their problem. No doubt they will want to reduce their offer so that they can pay to have it removed safely. They may just back out of the sale, too. But if you know about it and don't disclose it, depending on where you live, you can be sued.</p>\n<h2>3. Pest problems</h2>\n<p>Rats. Bed bugs. Cockroaches. If your home is plagued with pests, most states require you to disclose the issue to the buyers. Even if you have things under control with an exterminator, you'll still need to tell the new owners that there's a pest problem they need to stay on top of.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the pests may not even come from the home, but from a neighboring property (this happens a lot in apartments in New York City). If you have bugs or mice coming in from another property, still let the buyers know. It's only fair. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-cheap-ways-to-get-rid-of-household-pests?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Cheap Ways to Get Rid of Household Pests</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Ghosts (yes, ghosts)</h2>\n<p>The idea that a house could be haunted is somewhat far-fetched to say the least. However, some people believe in the paranormal. If you, as the owner, genuinely believe your home has an issue with a ghostly presence, some states require that you warn the new owners about it. If you've had an exorcism done, that should be disclosed as well.</p>\n<h2>5. Lead paint</h2>\n<p>Lead paint was once used throughout homes because it dried faster, kept its fresh color longer, and resisted mold. It also had a sweet taste, which caused children to eat lead chips, and had the nasty side effect of kidney damage, nervous system issues, and stunted growth.</p>\n<p>Any home built before 1978 must have a disclosure form stating whether lead paint is present in the home or not. Hiding this can set you up for a lawsuit. If you genuinely don't believe there is lead paint in the home, you don't have to disclose it or investigate the presence of lead paint.</p>\n<h2>6. Bad neighbors</h2>\n<p>A bad neighbor can turn a beautiful home into a nightmare. And while it's not exactly legally required to disclose nuisance neighbors (except in California), it's in your best interest as a seller to tell any potential buyer about the problem.</p>\n<p>For example, the neighbor might throw loud parties until 2 a.m. every weekend. To some people, that's no big deal. To others, it can be a cause of such frustration and turmoil that they find themselves caught in a war, with the police often getting involved. Just be upfront about the issues. If the neighbor is a registered sex offender, you'll want to disclose that information, too.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>7. Water damage</h2>\n<p>Whether the damage was caused by a leaky roof, an overflowing bathtub, a flood, or any other kind of water-related incident, you must disclose this kind of past issue. You may think that because you fixed the leak in the roof or painted over the stain on the ceiling that you're all good. That's not the case. There could be damage that you cannot see, especially in the case of a basement flood or leaking ceiling.</p>\n<p>The golden rule here is if water has entered the structure and caused any kind of damage, you have to let the new owners know. And if the water has created a mold problem that you have covered up with paint or wallpaper, you have to disclose that as well.</p>\n<h2>8. Any natural disasters that affect the home</h2>\n<p>If you're unlucky enough to live in an area that occasionally gets hit by an earthquake, hurricane, tornado, wildfire, flood, or any other kind of natural hazard, depending on the state laws, you may have to let the new buyers know. This also goes for a home that is near a cliff erosion. You can't just assume they know the home is located in tornado alley, or that the local river floods every spring. (See laso: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-filing-an-insurance-claim-after-a-natural-disaster?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">What You Need to Know About Filing an Insurance Claim After a Natural Disaster</a>)</p>\n<h2>9. Foundation problems</h2>\n<p>The foundation of a home is a big deal, so if there are problems with it, you have to fix them, or let prospective owners know what the issue is and an estimate of what it will cost to repair. According to Home Advisor, the <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/foundations/repair-a-foundation/\" target=\"_blank\">average cost to repair foundation issues</a> comes in at over $4,000, although it can go as high as $11,000 for a serious repair. That's a big chunk of change that the new owners will have to fork over, and they won't want to find out after they've moved in.</p>\n<p>You would probably be better off getting it repaired yourself before putting the home on the market, as any sentence including \"foundation problem\" and \"home for sale\" is going to put a lot of people off. They may even think it's going to cost way more to fix than it actually does.</p>\n<h2>10. Termite damage</h2>\n<p>Most lenders require a separate termite inspection anyway, so trying to conceal it will only come back to bite you. But if you have termite damage and the pesky little critters are still eating away at the structure, the buyer's lender can back out of the loan. If you had termite damage and had the problem taken care of, make sure you show the new buyers evidence of this. Termite damage is very expensive to repair, so you need to prove that you dealt with it.</p>\n<h2>11. Any significant repairs or improvements</h2>\n<p>If you did anything to the property that required a permit to be pulled, you should tell any prospective buyers about that project. If it required a permit and you didn't get one, it's even more important to come clean about it. Any large scale projects including a remodel, new roof, major plumbing or electrical work, an extension, and even heating and air conditioning should be disclosed in full.</p>\n<p>With repairs, it's just as important to let the new owner know. It's possible the issue could return, or that it did some damage that they need to know about.

It's one of your older cards, and you've bought plenty with it. The problem is, it charges an annual fee, and you're sick of paying it. You're tempted to cancel the card to eliminate the fee altogether. But you know doing so will hurt your credit score.</p>\n<p>Should you cancel your card? Or should you continue paying that annual fee when you could easily find another credit card that provides a generous rewards program without any annual charges? (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-fees-you-need-to-stop-paying-right-now?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Fees You Need to Stop Paying Right Now</a>)</p>\n<h2>Why you shouldn't cancel your card</h2>\n<p>It can be tempting to cancel any credit card that charges an annual fee, especially if that fee is a big one. But canceling a credit card can hurt your credit utilization ratio. This ratio measures how much of your available credit you are using at any one time. The more credit you use, the more your credit score will drop.</p>\n<p>When you close a credit card, your credit utilization ratio will automatically increase, even if you don't make any new purchases. Say you have three credit cards with a total of $15,000 of available credit. You are using $5,000 of that $15,000 in available credit. If you close one of those three cards — the card with a credit limit of $3,000 — you're left with a total credit line of $12,000 rather than $15,000, ultimately increasing your credit utilization ratio. This is why financial experts recommend keeping credit card accounts open even if you aren't using them.</p>\n<p>The age of your credit matters, too. The older your credit, the better it is for your score. So if you close an older card, even if it does charge an annual fee you'd rather not pay, you will also hurt your credit score.</p>\n<h2>How to get rid of that annual fee</h2>\n<p>How, then, can you get rid of that annual fee without damaging your credit score? You'll have to call your bank and negotiate.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Some banks will agree to downgrade your credit card's annual fee and move it to another <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-credit-cards-with-no-annual-fees?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">card that doesn't charge any fees</a>, or at the very least, offers a lower annual fee. Doing so won't hurt your credit score because you'll maintain your existing credit limit and you won't be closing an older credit card.</p>\n<p>Why would a bank approve such a downgrade? Mainly because it doesn't want to lose you as a customer. If you tell customer service that you are considering canceling the card if the annual fee doesn't go away, many credit card providers will agree to a downgrade. They'll earn more money from your continued business than they would have from that annual fee.</p>\n<p>It helps, of course, if you always make your payments on time. Your provider will be more interested in retaining your business, too, if you actually use your card on a regular basis. If you haven't made a purchase on your card in months, your provider might be less likely to approve your request for a downgrade.</p>\n<p>When you downgrade to a card with no annual fee, you will lose out on perks the original card offered. Your new rewards program won't be as strong. Your new card might not have a rewards program at all. If that's worth dumping the annual fee, though, downgrading your credit card might still be the smart financial move.

Often, they're accused of being spendthrift and irresponsible. Critics assume that Millennials are unable or unwilling to save money or invest smartly.</p>\n<p>Much of this criticism is unfair. In fact, if you look at what Millennials have accomplished with their finances, they have a lot to be proud of.</p>\n<h2>1. More than one in three Millennials own a home</h2>\n<p>Pew Research Center reports that about 35 percent of Millennials now own homes. That's still lower than the national average overall, but many experts say that an increase in Millennial homeownership in recent years has helped boost the overall rate of ownership to its first increase since before the Great Recession. Given the headwinds facing Millennials (high housing costs, student loan debt, stagnant wages), a homeownership rate of more than one-third is nothing to sneeze at.

Millennial homeowners have good credit</h2>\n<p>Research from Ellie Mae, a platform provider for the mortgage finance industry, showed that mortgages to Millennials weren't going to people with terrible credit. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.elliemae.com/about/news-reports/press-releases/average-credit-scores-for-millennial-homebuyers-continue-to-decrease-november-ellie-mae-millennial-tracker-finds\" target=\"_blank\">average FICO score among Millennial borrowers</a> in 2017 was 723, which falls in the \"good\" range.

Millennials are hitting their savings goals</h2>\n<p>A 2018 Bank of America survey revealed that about two-thirds of Millennials who have a savings goal are able to stick to it each month. In fact, 16 percent of Millennials have $100,000 or more socked away in savings. And 59 percent of this demo feels financially secure. These stats directly contradict the assumption that Millennials don't know how to save and waste every dollar they earn.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Millennials ask for raises, and often get them</h2>\n<p>If you're a Millennial, there's a good chance you've summoned the courage to ask for a pay increase, and have gotten one. Bank of America reported that 46 percent of Millennials have asked for a raise in the last two years, and 80 percent of those people have received higher pay. Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, and other generations have lagged behind in asking for more money.

Millennials have made investing cheaper and easier</h2>\n<p>It used to be that investing was exclusively for the elite, and you could only trade stocks through a human stockbroker who charged high commissions. But in the last 20 years since Millennials began investing, costs have come down. Index funds with super-low expense ratios have revolutionized investing. Discount brokerages are engaged in a race to the bottom on the commissions charged per trade.</p>\n<p>And there are also tons of smartphone apps that make it easier to buy even fractional shares of stock. Millennials are also responsible for the surge in new services such as robo advisors, account aggregators, and more.

There are many hidden issues that can emerge after you buy a property that are expensive to correct. Spending a few hundred dollars to have a professional home inspection beforehand is a good way to avoid costly surprises with your new property — but only if you get a reliable home inspector who will carefully check out your house and identify these issues.</p>\n<p>This year, I discovered that an inadequate home inspection cost me over $10,000. My roof started leaking, causing damage inside. When a roofing contractor checked it out, he had me come up on a ladder and showed me that there were three layers of shingles on most of the roof. The new shingles on the top layer were covering up all kinds of problems underneath. The roofer was surprised that my home inspector didn't let me know about the poor condition of the roof. It turns out that my home inspector never even went up on the roof during his inspection. The inspection report had a photo of the roof taken from the ground, but it looked okay since it had new shingles on top.

Here's What It Will Cost You</a>)</p>\n<p>Had I known that the roof was failing, I could have negotiated a new roof as part of the purchase agreement, or I could have replaced the roof before it started leaking and saved myself a lot of stress. I could have avoided getting an inadequate home inspection by asking the right questions.</p>\n<p>Here are some questions to ask before hiring a home inspector for your future home.</p>\n<h2>1. Who is recommending this home inspector?</h2>\n<p>Be wary of home inspectors who are recommended by your banker or by your real estate agent. These parties are motivated to have a home inspection that goes smoothly and results in a deal that closes so that they get paid. They will tend to recommend \"easy\" home inspectors that are not as likely to point out issues that could derail the sale.</p>\n<h2>2. What are your qualifications to be a home inspector?</h2>\n<p>Good qualifications for a home inspector would include experience working in the home construction or home repair industry and training to become a home inspector. But there are online courses that almost anyone can take and become a home inspector. I would be more comfortable hiring a home inspector who has background that goes beyond basic home inspection training.</p>\n<h2>3. How much experience do you have as a home inspector?</h2>\n<p>You can learn a lot by asking home inspector candidates how many homes they've inspected. A high number indicates that they're focused on home inspections and have likely learned from experience. A low number indicates that they're a newly minted home inspector, or that home inspections are just a side job and not their main focus.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. What is included (and not included) in the inspection?</h2>\n<p>Your home inspection may not include everything you're expecting, so it's worth reviewing what's actually included. Home inspections may not include coverage for pests or hazardous materials such as lead and asbestos, radon, or mold. Inspection of structures not attached to the house such as yard sheds or other buildings and swimming pools may not be included.</p>\n<p>Based on my recent experience, it's also worth asking if the inspector checks all parts of the roof for roofing issues. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-homebuying-questions-youre-embarrassed-to-ask?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Homebuying Questions You're Embarrassed to Ask</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Could you provide a sample home inspection report?</h2>\n<p>Some home inspection reports I've received over the years have a lot of \"boilerplate\" text and checklists that are not very informative. These reports rely heavily on automatically generated text about things that might be issues in general, but are not actually comments from the home inspector about the property. Reports that have a lot of photos from the inspection and comments from the home inspector with specific recommendations are the most valuable. Some inspection reports even have rough estimates for how much it would cost to resolve issues. Compare some sample reports and pick one that has information that'll be useful to you.</p>\n<h2>6. How much does a home inspection cost?</h2>\n<p>The buyer of a house normally pays for the home inspection, which typically runs in the range of a few hundred dollars. Compared to the price of a house, the cost of a home inspection is small, but you don't want to be surprised by a much bigger-than-expected home inspection bill.</p>\n<h2>7. When would you be able to complete the home inspection?</h2>\n<p>If you have signed a purchase agreement for a property, there may be a date by which the home inspection must be completed and accepted by the buyer. You need to get the home inspection report in time to use it to negotiate repairs from the seller, or even to be able to walk away from the deal if there are major issues. Find out if the home inspector you're dealing with has a huge backlog of work that would prevent him or her from meeting your schedule.</p>\n<h2>8. Can you walk through the house with me?</h2>\n<p>Walking through the property with the home inspector at the end of the inspection may be the most valuable part of the home inspection. This is an opportunity to ask questions and learn more about any issues that were discovered, and about the house in general. While you have access to the space, you can also take measurements and plan for where your big items will go when you move in.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

This fixer-upper needed a lot of TLC, but was in a good neighborhood. He'd found a diamond in the rough. Arnold set to work bringing the home back to life through a series of major renovation projects. Soon after, his mother's health took a turn for the worse.</p>\n<p>\"I kept my mother out of the nursing home for two years before she passed away,\" he recalls. His devotion to his mother is admirable — but it caused him to fall behind on bills.</p>\n<p>To avoid losing the home and all the money he'd invested, Arnold agreed to sell his home to an investor. He'll rent it from that investor for two years with the option to purchase the home again at a fair market price.</p>\n<p>Losing your home to a foreclosure or tax sale is not the only option for struggling homeowners. A short sale lease-back allows a homeowner to sell their home and lease it back from the new buyer, forming a landlord-tenant relationship that lasts for the term of the lease.</p>\n<p>There are several ways to get a short sale lease-back on your home. We'll discuss three below.</p>\n<h2>Investor short sale lease-back</h2>\n<p>Struggling homeowners might be able to save their homes by selling the home to an investor before the foreclosure. Investors looking for rental property profit from the steady income and potential discounted purchase price. The short sale will have to be approved through your lending institution. Once approved, the homeowner can avoid a credit-crushing foreclosure, rebuild their credit in the ensuing years, and stay in the home.</p>\n<p>At some point in the future, the previous homeowner and investor can negotiate a fair sale price. This allows the homeowner to recover their property and the investor profits on the sale.</p>\n<h2>Lender short sale lease-back</h2>\n<p>Homeowners can also check on lease-backs available with their mortgage lenders. Some lenders or mortgage holders will accept a lease-back arrangement in lieu of foreclosure by handing over your deed. In this situation as well, a suitable purchase arrangement can be worked out in the future once the homeowner has been able to recover financially and can qualify for a loan on the original home.</p>\n<h2>Nonprofit short sale lease-back</h2>\n<p>Homeowners can also turn to nonprofits that are approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/np\" target=\"_blank\">HUD-approved nonprofits</a> have been given the green light to conduct lease-back transactions after a 2011 change in the Making Home Affordable program.</p>\n<p>Homeowners may be required to attend financial management training as a requirement for participating in a short sale lease-back program through HUD-approved nonprofit organizations.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Sellers beware</h2>\n<p>Homeowners facing foreclosure can be particularly susceptible to mortgage rescue scams or people who will take undue advantage of a homeowner's distress. Sellers attempting to avoid foreclosure must be diligent to ensure they are dealing with reputable people or businesses.</p>\n<h3>Do your research</h3>\n<p>Check with your state attorney's office, the Better Business Bureau, or the local Chamber of Commerce to find information about anyone before conducting the transaction. As with predatory lending, unscrupulous investment companies are quick to prey on people in a desperate, high-emotion situation where they fear losing their home. A quick Google search may return reviews about the company on various message boards that you can use to help make a decision. Try to locate individuals who've had a personal dealing with the investors to ascertain whether the company is reputable or not.

Each state may have specific requirements that need to be followed. It's best to work with a real estate attorney who has experience with short sale lease-back transactions. Contact the Bar Association for your state for referrals.</p>\n<h3>Keep your word</h3>\n<p>Homeowners fall behind for many reasons. If you're able to avoid a foreclosure with a short sale lease-back agreement, resolve to keep this new agreement. Make that a priority. Kunkler notes that if an agreement is going to fail, it's most often because the leasing party fails to honor the agreement.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

It can ruin relationships and financially devastate families. You've probably heard stories of people hiding accounts, buying big ticket items without their partner's knowledge, or cleaning out a joint bank account. Infidelity ruins trust and robs the relationship of financial stability and security.</p>\n<p>But what happens if you're the one who's been unfaithful? How do you correct the issue and change course? And most importantly, how do you win back your partner's trust and repair the damage?</p>\n<p>Addressing your financial unfaithfulness starts with honesty — which is a tough and scary thing to do. Here are a few ways to come clean after financial cheating. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-signs-youre-committing-financial-infidelity?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Signs You're Committing Financial Infidelity</a>)</p>\n<h2>Understand why you've been unfaithful</h2>\n<p>Before you drop the bombshell on your partner, it's a good idea to take a moment and understand why you did it in the first place. You really have to become introspective and do a bit of soul searching to understand your motives.</p>\n<p>The key is to be honest with yourself.</p>\n<p>Your reasons could be deep-seated issues that stem from your childhood. Or, they could be a simple momentary lapse in judgment and self-discipline. You could be driven by fear, lack of trust, or maybe you've just been given bad advice. It's important to unearth your fears, hidden control issues, or whatever is driving you to exhibit this behavior.</p>\n<p>It's also important to remember and convey to your spouse that your reasons don't excuse your behavior. Understanding facilitates correcting the behavior, but it doesn't absolve the wrong or heal the hurt. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/4-money-fights-married-couples-have-and-how-to-avoid-them?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Money Fights Married Couples Have — And How to Avoid Them</a>)</p>\n<h2>Repent with remorse</h2>\n<p>When you do reveal what you've done, be upfront and open. It's important that you don't try to downplay or sugarcoat your actions. And don't blame your partner for driving you to do what you've done. Your partner's actions may have contributed to your decision to be dishonest, but the onus is on you. </p>\n<p>It's also important that your confession is accompanied by a sincere and heartfelt apology. Most people need to see or feel remorse in order to begin the process of forgiveness. Showing remorse places you in a posture of humility and displays that you understand — to some degree — the depth of your actions. Give your spouse space to be angry and don't allow their anger to make you angry.</p>\n<p>Of course, the more egregious the infraction, the more you may need to apologize. Spending the grocery money on shoes can be wiped away with a simple sincere apology. However, stealing your partner's identity to finance a motorcycle you've kept hidden in a storage shed across town requires more than a shoulder shrug and flippant \"Sorry.\"</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Implement accountability and transparency</h2>\n<p>After you have confessed your financial infidelity and apologized to your spouse, you need to add some sort of reassurance that this won't happen again. At the very least, assure them that you are working to correct the issue. And that requires more than just a verbal statement.</p>\n<p>Most people are inherently good, but the fear of consequences and having to account for your actions also keeps you on the straight and narrow. Every time you think about robbing a bank, you might think about <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> and quickly reconsider. Accountability gently nudges you in the right direction. Accountability is your friend.</p>\n<p>Adding an accountability component provides a safeguard for both you and your partner. It shows that you are truly working to correct the issue. It can be something as extreme as adding your spouse to your bank and/or credit card accounts, or simply allowing them to review your statements with you each month. The key here is to do something that requires you to be accountable and transparent to someone else, and that provides some sort of preventive measure to stave off future occurrences.

Especially if it's something that will hurt them. Writing your spouse a letter explaining yourself is a great way to get things out in the open and start the conversation.</p>\n<p>This is especially true if verbal communication is difficult for you or if your partner is explosive or talks over you. It allows you to process your thoughts and explain exactly what you've done and how you feel in a clear and concise way. Keep in mind, it shouldn't take the place of a face-to-face conversation — it's merely a way for you to analyze, process, and explain things in a controlled environment before sitting down to talk further.</p>\n<p>When penning your letter, make sure you follow the steps previously outlined. First, ensure you understand why you committed the infraction. Then, explain exactly what you've done in detail. Take full responsibility for your actions and explain your reasons for making the choices you've made. Make sure that you express remorse and sincerely apologize for your actions. From there, you want to propose a plan of action that allows you to be more accountable to your partner and ensure that this type of thing doesn't happen again. You also want to give your spouse room and permission to feel hurt, betrayed, and angry.</p>\n<p>Financial infidelity is serious and can ruin a relationship, especially if the infidelity is continuous. Your reasons for coming clean shouldn't be to rid yourself of guilt or to tell on yourself before your spouse finds out. It should be done because you understand that you've wronged your partner and want a relationship that is open and honest.

There are so many demands on our finances that it helps to get creative in order to save a few bucks now and then. Whether it's getting out of costly social events, fending off salespeople, or even postponing charitable donations, we all tell white lies to avoid spending once in a while. And that's OK! Here are some of the most common ones I've used, and you can, too. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-10-biggest-lies-we-tell-ourselves-about-money?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The 10 Biggest Lies We Tell Ourselves About Money</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. \"I have a lot of expenses right now.\"</h2>\n<p>Unless you're swimming in money, this isn't even a lie. If you own a home and have a family, chances are, you do have many ongoing expenses to juggle. From your mortgage to school activities, it can all add up. If you are dealing with a salesperson or even just a friend asking for money, drop this line and you'll usually slide right out of this interaction. No one needs to know exactly how burdensome these expenses actually are. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-friend-types-that-can-hurt-your-finances?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Friend Types That Can Hurt Your Finances</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. \"I already have one.\"</h2>\n<p>If someone is trying to sell you a product or service, you may be able to make them go away by insisting that you have no need for what they're selling, even if that's not the case. Remember that the entire motivation of salespeople is to convince you that you need something. Your job, in turn, is to convince them that you don't.</p>\n<p><strong>Salesperson</strong>: \"Can I interest you in some new windows?\"</p>\n<p><strong>You</strong>: \"Thanks, but I just got new ones installed last year.\"</p>\n<p>Those windows may be 20 years old, and the salesperson may be able to tell that you're lying. But they are also unlikely to pressure you much further.</p>\n<h2>3. \"I have a scheduling conflict.\"</h2>\n<p>You may not have a conflict at all. It's likely that the only date you have is with your sofa and a few episodes of <em>The Good Wife</em>. But when you have no interest in attending that bachelorette party — that will likely end up costing you quite a bit of cold hard cash — this is how you can wiggle out of it. Your excuse can be anything. A cousin is visiting from out of state. You're pet-sitting for a neighbor. It doesn't matter. The key here is to save money, but also save the relationship by offering to meet the person later for a less expensive, one-on-one outing. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-get-out-of-social-obligations-that-break-your-budget?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Get Out of Social Obligations That Break Your Budget</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. \"I'm trying to get healthier.\"</h2>\n<p>You may not be trying to lose weight at all, but when you go out to eat, avoiding appetizers, drinks, and desserts is a good way to avoid unwanted costs as well as calories. These things can nearly double the price of your meal. The next time your friend or coworker tries to urge you to get those cheese sticks, the extra beer, or the chocolate cake, just tell them you're trying to eat healthier. In fact, you could say \"I'm trying to cut back.\" They don't need to know that it's the spending you're cutting back on.</p>\n<h2>5. \"My car is in the shop.\"</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you'll be asked to attend an event or outing that requires a long drive. This would involve miles on the car, gas, tolls, parking, and other expenses. However, if you tell folks that you're having car trouble, you may be able to avoid the event, or save the wear and tear on your car by getting a ride there. Of course, this doesn't mean you should simply accept transportation for free. You should be a decent person and offer to pay for gas money or parking. But you'll likely still come out better financially than if you drove yourself.

Dinner dates. Happy hours. Weddings. Little League Baseball banquets. No one wants to be around a sick person, so it's a great excuse. This is not a trick you can pull too often, or you'll be called out as a fraud. But every once in a while, it's convenient — and cost-effective — to feel some \"flu-like symptoms.\"</p>\n<h2>7. \"I've already donated this year.\"</h2>\n<p>I admit it: I've lied to a Girl Scout. She was in front of a store selling those famous cookies and she asked if I could purchase a box. \"No, thanks,\" I said. \"I bought some recently.\" This was a lie. Truth be told, I just didn't want to spend the money on cookies.</p>\n<p>When faced with solicitations from charities, it's often hard to say no. Sometimes, simply saying, \"I've already donated,\" can end the conversation. And it doesn't mean you can't go back and give once you're in a position to be more charitable.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

I try to keep the whole trip easy, from the planning, to the packing, to the sitting around the campfire. Of course, there are always trade-offs; you can spend more time preparing at home and put in less effort while on the trip, or vice versa. I like to find that sweet spot where work is minimized at every stage. Most of that has to do with relaxing some of the standards I adhere to back in civilization. Here's how I make family camping a cinch, and how you can, too!</p>\n<h2>1. Camp locally</h2>\n<p>When I was a kid, some of my happiest camping memories were made at a place in central Texas called Jellystone Park, less than an hour's drive from my house. In the mornings, my dad would drive to work, while my mom, brother, and I made jars of colored sand and took turns going down the waterslide at the pool.</p>\n<p>An eight-hour drive to a national park might be what you dream of when planning summer camping, but if your family is new at it, start with a state park or a private campground within an hour or two of home. This way, you'll be able to make a quick getaway if there's a storm or someone gets sick. You can even run home if you forget something. And if one parent can't take the whole time off work, you can do like my dad did and head to the office from the campground. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/camping-for-a-week-is-only-160-at-these-national-parks?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Camping for a Week Is Only $160 at These National Parks</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Camp near a town</h2>\n<p>Some families strap on backpacks and hike miles into the woods before setting up camp. That's admirable, but that ain't my family, at least at this point in our lives. Some of our most enjoyable camping trips have been on the outskirts of small towns, where we could walk or take a short drive to the store to stock up on necessities. This way, you won't have to plan all your meals in advance, and you don't have to bring as many coolers or as much ice, because you can buy a day's worth of groceries at a time.</p>\n<h2>3. Choose an easy campground and campsite</h2>\n<p>National forest campgrounds are cheap and often easy to book. It's even possible to camp in the wilderness, find your own water source, and just dig a hole for your bathroom needs. But if you have young children and little appetite for roughing it, look for a campground with an on-site store, showers, laundry, and even a pool or an indoor activity room. Kampgrounds of America (KOA) offers hundreds of private campground options that often provide these types of amenities. They cost a little more than public campgrounds, but KOAs delight my kids with their pancake breakfasts and mini-golf courses.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep an eye out for is whether you get to park right by your campsite or you have to carry your belongings from a parking lot to your site. If you have big kids this may not be a problem, but with toddlers or babies, it can be tough to ferry gear back and forth while keeping track of the little ones.</p>\n<p>Once the campground is chosen, you're not done. Study the campground map. (<a href=\"https://www.reserveamerica.com/outdoors/tent-camping.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ReserveAmerica</a> has maps for state parks and some other camping areas.) I like to pick sites near enough to the bathrooms that my kids can visit them alone. If water spigots or electric outlets are only available at some sites, I get one of those.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, if there is a lazy river or pond in the campground, you want to be far away from that because that's where the mosquitoes will be. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-simple-all-natural-bug-and-mosquito-repellents?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Simple All Natural Bug and Mosquito Repellents</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Lower your beauty standards</h2>\n<p>We don't pack that much in the way of beauty and hygiene products. A hairbrush and toothbrush for each kid, some toothpaste and hand towels to share, a beach/shower towel for each person, some soap and deodorant, and we're good to go. The most important personal care products you will bring are your sunscreen and bug spray.</p>\n<p>I don't bring stuff like shampoo, conditioner, makeup, or razors because I greatly lower my beauty standards in the woods. Showering or bathing every other day might be a firm rule at home, but while camping, I'm fine with my kids going the whole week without a shower if they want. I do, however, try to keep them brushing their teeth twice a day while camping. That has to do with health, not necessarily beauty.</p>\n<h2>5. Load up on baby wipes</h2>\n<p>Even if you no longer have babies, these things are clutch for camping. If you don't have access to a shower, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rScFJm\" target=\"_blank\">baby wipes</a> will be your hygiene go-to. Even at campgrounds with showers, wipes can come in handy for cleaning kids' grubby hands before a snack without hiking to the bathrooms. And if anyone gets car sick on the way there, you're ready for cleanup.</p>\n<h2>6. Bring all kinds of lighting</h2>\n<p>It's important to have a light source that doesn't need to be handheld. We have some tabletop lanterns with handles that can be hung inside the tent or from a clothesline as needed. Other handy lights are headlights and small <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Iw6O3k\" target=\"_blank\">LED flashlights</a> that can be slipped into pockets. These tend to disappear as a trip goes on, so buy lots of inexpensive lights and scatter them everywhere. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KxU2lF\" target=\"_blank\">Glow stick bracelets</a> or necklaces are also an affordable way to keep track of your kids in the dark.</p>\n<h2>7. Don't skimp on sleeping arrangements</h2>\n<p>After trying a number of camping products, I have become resigned to the fact that I was not built to rough it when it comes to sleeping. I can easily go a week without makeup, but I'm not happy if I try to sleep on a foam pad on the ground.</p>\n<p>Last summer, my family bought a big <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LbjSNr\" target=\"_blank\">Aerobed</a>, and we used the electrical outlet in our car to blow it up. I slept like a baby, and will bring it on every camping trip from now on. The only other thing that has given me serious comfort during camping is a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rQYYdu\" target=\"_blank\">hammock</a> — which is a lot cheaper and easier to pack, if you don't get too cold at night. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-air-mattresses?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The 5 Best Air Mattresses</a>)</p>\n<h2>8. Bring easy activities</h2>\n<p>My kids spend a lot of time playing in the woods and making up games involving their favorite trees, but everyone should have a book with them for quiet times, and bringing a board game is always a good idea.</p>\n<p>You can certainly implement a no-gadget rule, but if one of your kids is driving you crazy, you could always give them some tablet time alone in the tent or car.</p>\n<h2>9. Pack firemaking tools</h2>\n<p>I am a Girl Scout leader and I know how to construct a killer fire with a single match, but I'm also not above starting with a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Gv4CYk\" target=\"_blank\">Duraflame log</a> if I don't feel like working at it. A box of long stick matches is also helpful.</p>\n<h2>10. Bring all the baby gear you need</h2>\n<p>If you're camping with a baby, you already get a medal. You don't need to rough it by going without the things you rely on at home to keep baby safe and happy. I'm not saying you have to bring all 1,000 pieces of baby equipment in your house, but if you think you might need something and you have room in the car, don't deny yourself.</p>\n<p>Bringing a portable playpen could literally be a lifesaver, because an air mattress is not a safe surface for a baby to share. When we camped with our babies, I really appreciated having a safe place to stash the baby when I was cooking. Some <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IylIq6\" target=\"_blank\">portable playpens</a> even have changing table attachments, which is great because no one really wants you to change the baby on the picnic table.</p>\n<h2>11. Bring a huge tent</h2>\n<p>You'll already be dealing with more togetherness than anyone is used to while on a family trip. Don't feel bad about getting a huge tent so that sleeping bags don't have to be crowded up against each other. Or if the kids want their own tent, you can bring a small one just for them and let them set it up themselves.</p>\n<p>Bonus: You won't have to step over their mess in your own tent.</p>\n<h2>12. Pack with clear tubs</h2>\n<p>Clear plastic storage containers allow you to see everything you brought without having to unpack everything. They will keep everything dry and if the containers have a good latch, they’ll prevent animals from getting into anything. You can even stack them to make a temporary work surface at the campsite.</p>\n<p>When you're done with your trip, store your camping supplies in the same tubs, labeled, to make packing for the next trip a breeze.

Consider renting a specialty vehicle</h2>\n<p>The closest my family has gotten to renting an RV for camping is renting a Jucy — a minivan converted for camping use — and we loved it so much that the kids are begging to do it again this summer. The beauty of a converted van is that it drives like an ordinary passenger vehicle, but it has a little kitchen in the back with a mini-fridge, sink, drawers, and a stove. These things come with all your silverware and dishes. You also have a pop-up tent with a padded floor on the roof, allowing you to go camping with very little preparation.</p>\n<p>The Jucy made days at the beach during our trip a breeze, since we had cold food waiting for us in our fridge in the parking lot. I also loved stopping at a grocery store and loading my purchases directly into the fridge in the back of the van.

Arrive before dark</h2>\n<p>Last summer, my family went on a camping trip and it was lovely — except the first night, when we arrived after sundown and struggled to put up two large tents on an unfamiliar, irregularly-shaped site.</p>\n<p>When you're on a weekend trip, it can be tempting to leave after work on a Friday to get the most camping time in, but if there's a chance that traffic or a delayed start might land you there after dark, think twice.</p>\n<p>You should also stop for a meal on the way to the site, so you don't have to worry about cooking while also setting up the tents the moment you arrive.</p>\n<h2>15. Make your kids help</h2>\n<p>After a long drive, your kids will want to run around and play. Let them do this, but only for five minutes. Then put them to work. Everyone above the age of infant should have a job when you pull into the campsite. Little kids can set up their own camp chairs and hold onto the bag of stakes while the tent is going up. At ages eight, 11, and 14, my kids can now set up the tent with little adult help.</p>\n<h2>16. Put up clothes lines</h2>\n<p>Having somewhere off the ground to hang everything, from damp towels to clothing to sleeping bags that need airing out, is really handy. It's also a great place to clip a lantern after dark to add more lighting to your campsite.</p>\n<h2>17. Don't try to be a fancy chef</h2>\n<p>I like to keep camping meals really simple. At home, we make pancakes from scratch, but at the campground, I've been known to bring the kind of pancakes you spray out of a can. I get precooked meats wherever possible because I've experienced the kind of mess you can make if a package of raw ground beef leaks in a cooler. And canned soup and boxed macaroni and cheese are lunchtime favorites.</p>\n<p>Simple also means fewer dishes to wash. I confess that I resort to a lot of individual packaging when camping. I've purchased those individual boxes of cereal, which the kids <em>love</em>, and cases of granola bars and canned sparkling water are my best friends.</p>\n<p>If you want to avoid waste, there are a lot of ways to prepackage things using upcycling. Don't want to buy ready-made pancake batter? You can make it at home and package it in a ketchup bottle for the same ease with less waste. Instead of individually packaged granola bars, you can make granola at home and store it in an empty coffee creamer bottle for easy snacking.</p>\n<p>Pre-measuring ingredients such as flour, spices, etc., allows you to both throw together meals more easily and pack less, since you only bring as much as you need of each ingredient.</p>\n<p>Or you can go all out at home and cook the whole dish, then freeze it to reheat at the campground. My mom would often make a big pot of chili or spaghetti sauce before we went camping. If you have leftovers already stored in your fridge, you're all set to grab and go.

Bring your cooking gadgets — or not</h2>\n<p>If you like to pack less, try to get a campsite with a grill or a grate that goes down over the fire and bring a bag of charcoal. On one trip last summer when we forgot to pack our camp stove, we managed to cook all kinds of meals, including bratwurst, eggs, and grilled cheese, right over the fire with little hassle.</p>\n<p>But if you have a campsite with electrical hookups — or even a converter to plug into your car for electricity — you can use all your gadgets to make cooking easier at the campground. Folks are bringing their <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2s1ih3T\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Pots</a> camping, and I may just try it this summer.

Try to get everything dry before packing up</h2>\n<p>Sweep or use a portable vacuum cleaner on the inside of the tent and wipe any dew off the sides before packing it up. If you can't get it clean and dry — like if it's pouring out during your departure — you'll have to set the tent up again in your yard when you get home in order to prevent mold from forming. To make your next trip easy, double check for moisture or any odors in the bins, your tent bag, and sleeping bags before storing them.</p>\n<p>For me, the exception to this is dishes. Although I like to keep a dedicated bin of cooking utensils and dishes for camping, I do run them through the dishwasher when I get home before repacking them. I wash the dishes at camp before heading home, but I don't pay too much attention to how they get thrown in the bin since I know I'll be redoing it in the comfort of my kitchen.</p>\n<h2>20. Keep all your camping gear in the same place</h2>\n<p>Stack all those clear bins full of clean, dry, ready-to-go camping gear in the same area of your garage or crawl space, so that next time, you can throw them in the car and go. If you need to replace or repair something, do it now instead of putting it off until you're getting ready for your next trip. If you make a habit of having everything ready before you store it, you won't have to waste time going through everything before the next trip.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Here are five questions to ask yourself before deciding on private school for your child. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-times-you-should-choose-private-school-over-public?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Times You Should Choose Private School Over Public</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Can I afford it?</h2>\n<p>Before you even consider how great a certain school is, you have to know whether you can afford it or not. Will you have to get another job? Will sending your child to this school put unnecessary financial stress on your family? What will you sacrifice to send your child to private school?</p>\n<p>The national average private school tuition is about $10,302 per year, according to Private School Review, but of course this cost varies drastically depending on the area. For example, the average price of a private school in Iowa is almost $5,000, but over $16,000 in New York. Most private high schools cost more than private elementary schools, as well, so your cost will go up if you keep your child enrolled throughout their school life.</p>\n<p>Yes, this school might be an amazing opportunity for your child, but is the cost truly worth it? I'm not talking about just the sticker price of the school. You also have to weigh the cost of working longer hours and spending less time with your family in order to make it work. Really consider if you can afford the school and the sacrifices you might have to make along with it.

What are the hidden costs?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the costs of sending your child to a private school don't stop at the monthly tuition bill. There could be several other hidden costs as well, such as the cost of uniforms, expensive textbooks, fundraising fees, field trips, and other special events. Of course, don't forget about sports, elective classes, or after school activities. If the tuition bill is already tipping your budget into the negative, then the extra fees might be too much for your family to handle. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-save-money-on-kids-activities?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Save Money on Kids' Activities</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. How does it compare to the other schools nearby?</h2>\n<p>There must be a reason why you're considering a private school rather than a public one, so make a list of those reasons. Is it because of safety? A particular sport your child plays? Is it because of your religion? Or perhaps because private schools tend to look better on college applications?</p>\n<p>Once you have those written down, find out all you can about the private school versus the public schools in your area. For example, if safety is a main priority for you, find out how the private school maintains a safer campus than the other schools. What safety protocols do they have in place? How many incidents have there been in the past five years?</p>\n<p>It's important to dig deeper into these issues because you might discover that behind the high price tag and fancy test scores, the private school you had your eye on isn't much safer or better at getting students accepted to top colleges than you thought. On the other hand, the private school you're interested in might have a huge lead over other schools in athletics or academics, which makes the tuition easier to justify.</p>\n<h2>4. What will this school do for my child?</h2>\n<p>No one knows your child better than you do, so evaluate potential schools for what they will offer your child. Don't get distracted by impressive stats the school might advertise, like having an unbeatable mathletes team or having the highest number of full college scholarships for basketball players. Make a list of your child's strengths and weaknesses and discover how the school can support both. For example, if your child is naturally talented in theater arts but struggles in math, will this school give him or her unique opportunities to act and learn more about theater? Does the school offer special classes or tutoring to strengthen math skills, or will they be thrown into an advanced math class and expected to stay afloat?</p>\n<h2>5. What is student life like?</h2>\n<p>School is more than just academics; it's the place where students learn to socialize and create strong friendships. A school that boasts high test scores, but has miserable students is not a healthy environment for anyone. When evaluating the school, ask how the school gets the students involved in their local community. Are the students encouraged to partake in activities that help others outside of the school?</p>\n<p>You also want to learn how much time is given for breaks and socializing and how often the teachers encourage group projects and working together in the classroom.

What's the first thing that comes to mind? Maybe you enjoyed teaching your kids about new places, new cultures, or the history of the destination you visited. Or perhaps you were just tickled to give your kids some undivided attention without work or life getting in the way.</p>\n<p>What you may not have considered, is the fact that any kind of travel can be a learning opportunity — even if it's not too far from home. This is particularly true when it comes to lessons about money, because travel requires so many financial decisions.</p>\n<p>If you're angling to broaden your children's perspectives on money, keep an eye out for learning opportunities that may be less than obvious. Here are some lessons your kids can pick up no matter where you go.</p>\n<h2>1. The importance of budgeting and tracking spending</h2>\n<p>No matter how careful you are when you set your travel budget, it's easy to let your spending get out of hand. You're away from home and on a different schedule, and you're probably around food, souvenirs, and constant temptations to spend.</p>\n<p>That's why a family vacation may be the perfect time to introduce your kids to the concept of tracking your daily spending — it's one of the best ways to stay within your travel budget. To get your kids into this mindset, you just need to set a daily spending limit, then clue your kids into how it works. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-fool-proof-ways-to-stay-within-your-travel-budget?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Fool-Proof Ways to Stay Within Your Travel Budget</a>)</p>\n<p>My husband and I typically take our kids on a three- or four-week trip to Europe every summer. On these trips, we set a daily spending limit to cover food, souvenirs, and snacks. While the spending limit depends on where we are, it's usually enough to cover one meal \"out\" per day and a daily splurge like gelato or candy. We eat the rest of our meals in our condo or hotel.</p>\n<p>This really annoys my kids (ages six and nine) sometimes, but I explain that we have a budget for the entire trip and the only way to stay within our budget is by breaking it down by the day. They don't always like when we're in our hotel eating sandwiches for dinner, but they do understand why we do it.</p>\n<h2>2. How credit works</h2>\n<p>Tanner Calais, founder of Cruzely.com, says cruises are another opportune time to teach kids about spending and credit, since cruise lines have you charge all your expenses to a key card tied to your account. The system is similar to credit cards in that you're using \"invisible money\" to buy things, and you pay your bill at the end of the cruise. \"This is a great opportunity to introduce kids to the power of credit cards and how they work,\" says Calais.</p>\n<p>For instance, it can be tough to track your spending when you don't see it because you're using a card. By forcing the kids to watch you keep track of your daily purchases with a notepad or your smartphone, you can help them see how spending can add up over time. \"It's also not free money simply because cash doesn't come out of your wallet when you buy something,\" he says. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-money-saving-items-to-bring-on-your-next-cruise?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Money-Saving Items to Bring On Your Next Cruise</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Money doesn't grow on trees</h2>\n<p>Here's another lesson kids need to learn: Money is a finite resource.</p>\n<p>Eileen Gunn, founder of the blog Families Go Travel, says this is one lesson her child has learned by bringing her own souvenir money on vacation. Having her 10-year-old daughter bring her own stash of cash to spend has helped her learn that \"you can't have everything you want,\" says Gunn.</p>\n<p>For example, if she has $20 to spend on a trip and sees something she wants for $20, she has to decide whether she wants the item badly enough to spend her entire budget on it. She also has to make peace with the fact that she won't be able to afford anything else she wants for the duration of the trip.</p>\n<p>Gunn says she has occasionally loaned her daughter money when she was desperate to have another souvenir, \"but it has to be something really worthwhile.\" Also, Gunn makes her repay the loan as soon as they get home from their trip. The entire process \"makes her a more discerning consumer,\" says Gunn.</p>\n<h2>4. The power of compound interest</h2>\n<p>Travel blogger Kevin Payne, founder of Family Money Adventure, offers the perfect example of how you don't have to travel far to teach your kids about money and finance. Recently, part of his family had an epic staycation in their hometown of Cleveland, Ohio while his two older kids were in New York City. They visited the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, including its Learning Center and Money Museum.</p>\n<p>Payne says he and his children learned many money lessons during the trip, including the history of bartering and why money is a better system of exchange. But that's not all.</p>\n<p>\"I think the biggest lesson they learned was the importance of saving money and the role of interest,\" he says. The museum accomplishes this goal via a staircase to its second level that illustrates the power of compound interest on every step.</p>\n<p>\"Each step represented a year more of interest so the kids could see how much money they would end up with after a 20-year period of saving,\" says Payne. \"It was such a great way to illustrate how quickly savings can add up.\" (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-investing-lessons-you-must-teach-your-kids?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Investing Lessons You Must Teach Your Kids</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. The power of negotiation</h2>\n<p>In some countries, local markets provide a powerful lesson in bargaining. Travel blogger Shannon O'Donnell, founder of A Little Adrift, has had periodic custody of her niece, and she has used that time to travel with her and teach her about money.</p>\n<p>O'Donnell says that, while they were in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar, her then 11-year-old niece learned to critically evaluate the cost of something she wanted, plus how to respectfully bargain if she wanted a better deal.</p>\n<p>\"She would use this skill at the local markets if she wanted to buy a souvenir and became quite good at disarming them with a smile as she politely asked for better deals,\" says O'Donnell. \"Overall, by learning that some cultures bargain for better deals, it has allowed her to consider the value of her purchases and how she spends her money even when back home in the states.\"</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. How you can save money while still having fun</h2>\n<p>While travel isn't typically cheap, there are still plenty of ways to save. Blogger Lee Huffman of Dads Who Travel says he uses travel to teach his kids that you can save money on some aspects of your trip and still have a blast.</p>\n<p>One strategy he uses to impart this message is booking accommodations that have some sort of kitchen. This allows them to save money on food by buying groceries. \"For example, on our last trip to Orlando, we stayed at a timeshare property that offered a mini-kitchen with a fridge, microwave, and two-burner stove,\" says Huffman.</p>\n<p>They still have a boatload of fun on their trips, but he goes out of his way to explain to his kids why dining out for every meal would make each trip cost considerably more.</p>\n<h2>7. Be grateful for what you have</h2>\n<p>Corinne McDermott, founder of Have Baby Will Travel, says travel has helped her kids understand how fortunate they are. During her family's frequent trips to the Caribbean, they often talk about how people's homes are different and how the children appear to have fewer belongings. Yet, the people they meet are still happy and thriving.</p>\n<p>\"We've been fortunate to meet and socialize with many locals on our travels, and they work hard and are as proud of their homes and families as we are of ours,\" says McDermott. \"Occasionally we all need reminders to be grateful for all that we have, no matter how it compares to others next door or across the world.\"</p>\n<h2>8. Being able to travel means parents have to work</h2>\n<p>Family finance writer Catherine Alford agrees that travel offers an endless number of opportunities to teach your kids about money. However, the most important lesson she wants to teach her kids is that, in order to travel, Mom and Dad have to work. \"I've been teaching them the connection between hard work and purchases since they were babies,\" she says.</p>\n<p>When her children were two years old, Alford and her husband took them on a monthlong European vacation where they visited five different countries. Since she works remotely as a blogger and freelance writer, Alford had to work throughout the trip. \"I kept reminding them that we were able to travel because Mommy was working,\" she says.</p>\n<h2>9. Experiences are better than things</h2>\n<p>For many families, prioritizing travel means they need to cut back on other kinds of purchases in their everyday lives. Those are often sacrifices they're happy to make. Shannon Austin, senior communications director at the Center for Financial Services Innovation says one of the biggest lessons her family has learned from travel is that they can have amazing experiences if they maintain a reasonable lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Austin and her children had the opportunity to live in Germany for three years when her oldest was six and her youngest was two. Once they moved abroad, she says she told her kids that they planned to \"live small so they can experience big.\" Over the three years they spent in Germany, they took 36 trips to destinations including Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Austria.</p>\n<p>\"My oldest delights in noticing some flowers that remind her of the plants growing over terraces in Ronda, Spain; my youngest recalls riding donkeys in Santorini. They remember filling water bottles on the roadside at a waterfall in Norway; they remember hikes in the Franconian part of Germany,\" says Austin. These memories are priceless, she says, but they were only possible because her family prioritized travel instead of \"stuff.\" (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-reasons-you-should-splurge-on-experiences-not-things?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Reasons You Should Splurge on Experiences, Not Things</a>)</p>\n<h2>10. How currency exchange works</h2>\n<p>Travel can also help teach your kids how money works around the world. Tracey Carisch, author of the upcoming memoir <em>Excess Baggage: One Family's Around-the-World Search for Balance, </em>says her children gained firsthand experience in how currency works when they traveled nomadically for 18 months.</p>\n<p>Carisch says her oldest child began to understand how different types of currency work when they arrived in South Africa from Ethiopia. They found a currency exchange booth at the airport and went to exchange their remaining Ethiopian birr for South African rand. As she was talking to the cashier, she mentioned to her daughter that they made a little money on the trip due to the favorable exchange rate.</p>\n<p>\"My daughter's curiosity was piqued and she started peppering me with questions,\" says Carisch. \"Within five minutes, she understood the concept behind currency trading and cross rates. She researched it on Forex and came up with a home-school module for herself based on reading currency pairs and calculating spreads.\"</p>\n<p>Carisch also says her child \"doesn't even like math.\" This just goes to show how powerful travel can be when it comes to learning about money and math. You can learn and forget almost anything in a classroom, but real world experiences teach lessons that last a lifetime.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

While some issues are unavoidable (the hotel room isn't ready, the rental car breaks down, someone gets sick), there are others that can be avoided if you pay close attention to travel advisories. These warnings are given days, or even weeks, in advance, and can save you time, money, and in extreme cases, can even mean life or death.</p>\n<h2>1. Extreme weather</h2>\n<p>Weather is one of the easiest vacation issues to predict. Advances in meteorological science mean that weather experts can predict major problems with a reliable degree of accuracy. That means hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, torrential rain, extreme heat, blizzards, and even dangerous hail are literally on the radar for meteorologists.</p>\n<p>If they warn you of these weather conditions before you are set to travel anywhere, rethink your plans. Extreme weather shifts like this can ground planes, cause car crashes, wipe out roads and buildings, and lead to serious injury and death. Don't mess with mother nature; you'll lose.

Civil unrest and political upheaval</h2>\n<p>Most of us are fortunate enough to live in a land of (relative) peace. It's easy to forget that in some parts of the world, citizens are in a fight for justice, and their lives, on a daily basis. If you are not up on the latest news from around the world, you could be in for a rude awakening when you get to your destination. For example, the U.S. government is currently advising you to reconsider travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela, and Sudan, among others, due primarily to crime and civil unrest in these regions.</p>\n<p>If you must travel to these areas, perhaps for work or a family emergency, you should exercise extreme caution and take the necessary steps to stay safe when you arrive. Consider a local trusted guide or escort who can advise you on where to go and, more importantly, where to avoid.

Health and disease</h2>\n<p>While modern medicine safeguards us and helps us recover from all kinds of communicable diseases, you cannot take any risks when traveling abroad. That's why you should always check with the <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) before taking any kind of trip.</p>\n<p>Current notices at the time of this writing include an outbreak of malaria and listeriosis in South Africa, and malaria and yellow fever in Brazil. And since June of 2017, over 2,000 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been identified in multiple countries in the Arabian Peninsula. You can get additional vaccines before you travel, or if you are really concerned, change your plans to a different location. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-ways-to-stay-healthy-on-vacation?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Ways to Avoid Getting Seriously Sick on Vacation</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Terrorism</h2>\n<p>Since September 11, 2001, terror attacks have increased substantially in some parts of the world. The State Department currently has Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen on the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html\" target=\"_blank\">Do Not Travel list</a>, primarily due to incidents of terrorism.</p>\n<p>Many other countries get a Reconsider Travel notice for terrorism dangers, including Pakistan, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Lebanon. These terrorism warnings are constantly updated, so if you know you may be traveling to a part of the world that has been home to terrorist activity, check the list and consider your alternatives.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>5. Crime and personal safety</h2>\n<p>While the two often go hand in hand, there are some distinctions to be made here. For example, many countries have a crime rate far in excess of anything you've experienced in the United States, and as such, you will not be prepared for the dangers without first researching the area. El Salvador, Burundi, Guatemala, Nigeria, and Mauritania are all flagged right now for problems with crime. Take the following precautions in places known to have a high crime rate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Consider hotels that offer secure parking, doormen, and a dedicated and professional security staff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Request security escorts, available for tourist groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be aware of your surroundings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid walking or driving at night.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not use public ATMs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While crime can certainly result in physical danger, there is another kind of personal safety issue you need to be aware of. It's known as \"risk of arrest and detention,\" and happens in places that have a volatile relationship with the U.S. North Korea is a prime example, and if you do not have special validation from the Department of State to travel in, or through, North Korea, you may find yourself in deep trouble.</p>\n<h2>6. Airline issues</h2>\n<p>Perhaps one of the most obvious, but often overlooked, travel warnings come from the airlines themselves. When we think of a travel advisory, we think of weather issues, health and disease, crime, and civil unrest. But one surefire way that your vacation can come to a grinding halt is when the airline has an issue. Anything from a computer system going down, to problems with labor negotiations and strikes, or mechanical malfunctions and serious delays, can put a serious dent in your plans.</p>\n<p>Every airline has its own alert page, so if you know which airline you plan on taking, check out that alert page regularly.</p>\n<h2>7. War</h2>\n<p>We live in turbulent political times. While some wars have been raging for decades, others could break out at the drop of a hat. If you're not following politics closely, you should take notice if the region you are traveling to is about to go to war (or is actually at war and you didn't even know it). The most infamous places right now are Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur, Myanmar, Nigeria, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, and the Central African Republic.</p>\n<p>Other danger zones closer to home are some regions of Mexico. Since 2006, the Mexican drug war has had over 106,000 casualties, with almost 15,000 of those coming in 2017 alone. The Mexican states of Colima, Guerrero<strong>, </strong>MichoacÃ¡n, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas are all currently on the Do Not Travel list due to crime.

Geological disasters</h2>\n<p>This is a broad term, because you could easily put extreme weather into this category. But in this instance, it's reserved for natural disasters. For example, when Iceland's volcano EyjafjallajÃ¶kull blew in 2010, massive clouds of ash made travel impossible for millions of people. An earthquake warning, or the threat of a volcanic eruption or a landslide, should be taken very seriously. If you're planning on traveling to a place known for these kinds of natural disasters, and there's evidence that you could be caught in something horrific, change your plans.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Their baby wasn't even a year old and hadn't yet discovered he could walk, Wang says. What was the worst that could happen?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, their baby refused to sleep the entire journey, and Wang had to walk the length of the plane to keep him busy. In the meantime, he \"just about lost his mind.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was a nightmare,\" he said, and an extremely long one. If he had to do things over, Wang says he would have probably just stayed home.</p>\n<p>Skipping the entire thing may sound good if you're facing a long flight with a baby or several kids, but it's not always feasible. Maybe you're desperate for a real vacation or need to travel to see family. Whatever the reason, flying with babies is sometimes inevitable.</p>\n<p>Many family travel pros say your flight doesn't have to be miserable. There are strategies parents can use to make the experience relatively painless. If you know what to prepare for — and what to avoid — flying with an infant can even be seamless.</p>\n<h2>1. Consider buying your baby an airline seat</h2>\n<p>While most airlines let children ages two and under share a seat with a parent (sometimes for a small fee), you do have the option to buy them a separate seat. That's one thing Wang, who writes about personal finance and frugality at Wallet Hacks, wishes he had done differently.</p>\n<p>\"We would've considered spending the extra money to buy a seat so we could use a baby seat that he was familiar with and stood a chance at sleeping in,\" he says. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/why-southwest-airlines-is-the-best-domestic-airline-for-families?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Why Southwest Airlines is the Best Domestic Airline for Families</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Bring out the screens</h2>\n<p>Another big fail the Wangs admit to is not bringing along any screens or digital entertainment. Yes, even a baby under the age of one may be entertained watching a movie or cartoon — at least for a while. Even if you have a \"no screens\" policy at home, a long flight is a good reason to reconsider — at least for the day and for your time in the airport.</p>\n<p>\"It's not good to put such a young kid in front of a screen, but for that special circumstance, I would've buckled,\" Wang says. \"Since it never occurred to us, we didn't have anything prepared so we couldn't even give in.\"</p>\n<p>Corinne McDermott, founder of the blog Have Baby Will Travel, agrees that technology is a must if your baby is old enough to care. \"The tablet is your friend,\" she says.</p>\n<h2>3. Plan your flights around the baby's sleep schedule</h2>\n<p>McDermott says another important consideration is what time you travel. And if you're able to pick among several different flights, you should tailor your schedule around your baby's natural rhythms.</p>\n<p>\"Try to book your flight for a time your baby is likely to sleep,\" she says. With this strategy, you may let your baby squeeze in their nap while you're in the air.</p>\n<p>You could even consider a red-eye flight that takes place overnight. But if you opt for this option, you should try to follow your baby's regular sleep schedule as much as possible. For example, have your baby change into pajamas, brush their teeth, and read them their normal bedtime stories.</p>\n<p>If this doesn't work, you should \"try to book for when your baby will be most cheerful,\" she says. If your baby is always crabby first thing in the morning but good by 10 a.m., for example, keep that in mind when you're booking your trip.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Bring stuff to do</h2>\n<p>While this might seem obvious, bringing stuff to keep your baby entertained is a stellar idea — even if you expect them to sleep. McDermott suggests stashing a few toys and books out of sight before your trip, then bringing them out on the plane as a surprise. \"Your baby or toddler will be happy to see old favorites while en route,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Depending on the age of your baby, old-school fun like crayons, blank sheets of paper, and a travel Etch-a-Sketch could be lifesavers. If your baby is a small infant, bring their favorite mobile, a boatload of pacifiers, board books, and whatever else your baby loves.</p>\n<h2>5. Dress for success</h2>\n<p>Since the temperature on planes can be so variable, you need to think about how you dress your baby before you leave for your trip, says writer and editor Melissa Mayer of Why Not Let's Go. Frequent flyers know that some planes tend to be hot while others can be overly cool. \"Babies are temperature-sensitive and you don't want to be unprepared,\" she says.</p>\n<p>The solution? \"Dress your baby in layers and have a blanket in your carry-on so you can cool down or warm up your baby if and when necessary,\" says Mayer. The blanket will also help provide comfort and block the light when it's time to sleep.</p>\n<h2>6. Make the airport experience as easy as possible</h2>\n<p>While flying with your baby is a big part of the travel experience, you'll also need to spend a few hours in the airport each way. This part of the trip can be important since it can set the tone for the rest of your journey.</p>\n<p>Sarah Hirsch, founder of the blog Well-Traveled Kids, says she believes upgrading to services like TSA Precheck and <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-sign-up-for-global-entry?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Global Entry</a> can be worth it to avoid long lines at the airport. While you can pay for these benefits outright, keep in mind that there are several travel <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/best-credit-cards-that-offer-tsa-pre-check-and-global-entry-reimbursement?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit cards that offer TSA Precheck and Global Entry</a> as a cardholder perk.</p>\n<p>Also, be prepared for TSA screening. \"If you are boarding with liquids for the baby, put those on the belt before your luggage so they can be tested while you are getting your bags and stroller through security,\" says Hirsch.</p>\n<p>Also, take your stroller in the airport and gate-check it before boarding the plane. This is better than checking the stroller with your luggage since you'll still have access to it while you're waiting in the terminal for boarding.</p>\n<h2>7. Bring a fully stocked diaper bag</h2>\n<p>Last but not least, make sure you are fully prepared for any typical day with your baby. This includes bringing extra clothes, bibs, diapers, diaper cream, and wipes. \"I've been stuck on the runway for hours and happy I had extra supplies,\" says Hirsch.</p>\n<p>You should also be prepared to change a diaper or two on the plane. This may have to go down in your seat since not all planes have a changing table. Also remember that diapers can and do fail — often at the worst times. \"My infant always had a blow out when the plane took off,\" says Hirsch. As the saying goes, better safe than sorry.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Everything we're told about raising children revolves around the importance of routine and stability — two things you're likely to lose on a travel day.</p>\n<p>It can be challenging just trying to get the kids off to school in the morning, let alone taking them to a new country on a one-week vacation. Travel days will likely be your biggest challenge because once you arrive at your hotel or resort, you can mostly relax and enjoy. But you can mitigate most of the stress and chaos of long travel days by packing the right items and following a few simple rules.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> (See also: </span><a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-wisely-choose-your-next-travel-destination?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 13px;\">How to Wisely Choose Your Next Travel Destination</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">)</span></p>\n<h2>1. Choose the right destinations</h2>\n<p>The right destinations for you and your family will depend on a lot of factors, as there's no one-size-fits-all destination. While you don't need to rule out certain countries because you're traveling with kids, you do need to take your children's ages into consideration to find locations that will be the most suitable for kids.</p>\n<p>Daily adventures like long hikes may be more difficult with younger children, whereas many teenagers will need things to keep them stimulated. A good way to ensure everyone is happy is to get them involved in the decision-making. Older kids can do their own research on the internet, while younger children can be given a number of options to choose from after explaining what each has to offer. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-affordable-vacations-to-please-every-age-group?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Affordable Vacations to Please Every Age Group</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Book family-friendly accommodations</h2>\n<p>Booking the right accommodation is vital to making traveling the world with your family a success. Those with kids, particularly younger ones, will attest that a good night's sleep can mean the difference between a fun day and a nightmare. Your options are obviously more limited than when you're solo traveling or with friends, with many hostels, guesthouses, and even some hotels operating a no-children policy.</p>\n<p>Your best options are to stay in hotel suites, or to rent full apartments through sites like Airbnb. Privacy is a must, and it's great to have your own space to relax in, and for the kids to have room to play and run around. You can narrow the hotel options on search engines by using the sort function to filter by family-friendly properties. Airbnb also enables you to find entire houses or apartments that are family-friendly. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-hotel-booking-websites-can-save-you-money-and-headaches?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How Hotel Booking Websites Can Save You Money</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Pack light</h2>\n<p>What to pack is often at the forefront of parents' minds when they make the decision to travel with their family. Just the thought of trying to condense all of the gear — particularly associated with younger children — down to a manageable amount can be daunting. Things like strollers, car seats, and carriers all take up huge amounts of space, and that's before toys, clothes, and everything else they might need. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-ways-families-can-travel-like-minimalists?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Ways Families Can Travel Like Minimalists</a>)</p>\n<p>Packing as light as possible will make moving around far easier, and will potentially save your family lots of money in excess baggage fees. As soon as your kids are old enough to carry a backpack or wheel a suitcase, it's a good idea to get them involved in the packing stage as well. They'll soon come to appreciate the importance of packing light, and will enjoy being involved in the process.</p>\n<p>Generally, anything that's an absolute necessity for children will be available pretty much anywhere you go, but here are a few things that you can pack to ensure that your travel day will run as smoothly as possible.</p>\n<h3>Baby wipes</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of germs on travel days and your little ones are going to be more susceptible to catching something on the road. Bring a few sanitizer or baby wipes and wipe down airplane seats, seat belts, handles and any surfaces your children may touch during the trip.</p>\n<h3>Comfort toy</h3>\n<p>Most children have some kind of toy, blanket, or pacifier that calms them down. Bring it! These simple items can be life savers.</p>\n<h3>Tablet</h3>\n<p>Load it up with all of your kid's favorite music, movies, and TV shows and let them play and watch to their heart's content. Keep in mind that while on buses and in cars, you may want to limit exposure as it can lead to motion sickness.</p>\n<h3>Child-sized luggage</h3>\n<p>Kids like to feel like adults from time to time, and by having their own carry-on luggage or backpack, not only will they feel like Mom and Dad, but they'll be able to carry some of their own things and access them when they feel like it.</p>\n<h3>Headphones</h3>\n<p>Even if you don't have a tablet or smartphone for your kids, you can usually plug in the headphones and let them watch the entertainment provided on planes and buses.</p>\n<h3>Lots of water</h3>\n<p>This is something you don't want to run out of. Bring plenty of water and have your kids carry their own bottle, either clipped to their person or onto their luggage.</p>\n<h3>Trash bags</h3>\n<p>With wet wipes, snacks, water bottles, and tissue, you're likely to have a lot of trash on travel days. Bring bags to easily store it all until you can ditch it in a proper trash bin.</p>\n<h3>Healthy snacks</h3>\n<p>Loading your kids up on sugar on travel days is just asking for trouble. Instead, pack low-sugar, healthy snacks like crackers, nuts, cheese sticks, Cheerios, and pretzels.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Sunscreen</h3>\n<p>Even if you're planning to be in the airport for most of your travel day, you never know if you'll be by the bus window on the tarmac or waiting in line to board the plane. Bring lots of sunscreen and keep everyone from getting burned. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-sunscreens?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The 5 Best Sunscreens</a>)</p>\n<h3>Camera</h3>\n<p>Keep your camera somewhere that you can easily grab it at a moment's notice. Funny things happen on travel days and it's always adorable to take a photograph of your kid boarding a plane or looking out the plane window.</p>\n<h2>4. Slow it down</h2>\n<p>Though it's completely possible to move from place to place relatively quickly with a family, if you have the luxury of an extended vacation, it's a much better idea to take it slowly and spend a good amount of time in each destination. This is important for practical reasons, like not having the hassle of unpacking and repacking every few days, but it will also allow you to create routines and provide a level of stability in each place.</p>\n<p>Slow travel will allow you the option of booking longer-term accommodation, which is likely to bring the cost down. Rather than staying in hotel suites, you'll be able to book houses or apartments via sites like Airbnb, where hosts regularly offer long-stay discounts, or directly with local landlords.</p>\n<p>Moving quickly can begin to feel like a whirlwind of activity and leave no time for your children to build attachments to places. In contrast, spending a few weeks or months in one spot will allow your kids to get familiar with the people and places at the location and give them a deeper connection.

Plan ahead when flying with babies</h2>\n<p>Generally, you won't pay for airline tickets for children under two years of age who sit in your lap, at least on domestic flights. However, you do still have to inform the airline when booking that you're traveling with a small child. You may also want to reserve a baby cot or bassinet with the airline in advance, or arrive early for those that operate on a first come, first served basis. It's generally free, but check with each airline for their individual policies.</p>\n<h2>6. Sign the kids up for frequent flyer miles</h2>\n<p>On many airlines, frequent flyer programs have no age minimum, meaning kids can earn points, as well as adults. They will have to have their own frequent flyer account in order to start accumulating the points, but that's just a matter of filling out a simple form. Pooling family members' points can be a quick way to multiply your earnings. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-frequent-flyer-miles?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Everything You Need to Know About Frequent Flyer Miles</a>)</p>\n<h2>7. Get a travel-friendly stroller</h2>\n<p>Nothing is more annoying than fumbling around with a bulky stroller while trying to check into a flight. You may want to consider an fold-up umbrella-style stroller or a lightweight, portable travel stroller. There are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2K6UkQ7\" target=\"_blank\">plenty on Amazon</a> to choose from, and most stores that carry strollers will also carry umbrella strollers and other lighter-weight options.</p>\n<h2>8. Make sure kids sit middle or window</h2>\n<p>The aisle seat is a surprisingly dangerous place for little ones. With heavy metal carts and people whizzing by, I've seen many a tiny finger squished by an unsuspecting passenger, who feels awful afterward.</p>\n<p>To avoid a lot of tears and potentially a broken finger, always try to seat your little ones in away from the aisle.</p>\n<h2>9. Have a \"what if I get lost?\" plan</h2>\n<p>This one seems obvious, but in the rush and chaos of getting everyone to the airport on time, many parents forget to form an emergency plan with their children on travel days. Whenever you arrive in a new place, let your child know which people are security or police and who to go to in the event of splitting up.</p>\n<p>Also, choose a safe and secure meeting point that you can all head to if for some reason you can't find one another. If your kids are a little older, make sure everyone has their phone volume on loud and set to vibrate so that you can call each other if anyone gets lost.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

If data breaches from big stores like Target and Home Depot several years ago didn't convince you of this fact, the 2017 Equifax data breach, which may have released the sensitive data of up to 145 million consumers, probably helped you realize how much peril your personal information could be in.</p>\n<p>If you've seen ads for credit monitoring services like LifeLock or Identity Guard, you may have wondered if signing up is worth it. You may have also heard about credit freezes and fraud alerts and wondered how those work. Before you take any steps to protect your credit and your identity, here's what you should know. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/dont-panic-do-this-if-your-identity-gets-stolen?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Don't Panic. Do This Instead If Your Identity Gets Stolen</a>)</p>\n<h2>The difference between credit monitoring, credit freezes, and fraud alerts</h2>\n<p>During the Equifax data breach, consumers' names, Social Security numbers, addresses, and, in some cases, credit card numbers were accessed by hackers. To control damages after the breach, Equifax created a special website where you could enter your information and <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/eligibility/eligibility.html\" target=\"_blank\">find out if you were affected by the Equifax breach</a>. It also began offering a year of free credit monitoring and other identity theft services to all U.S. consumers, whether their information was accessed during the data breach or not.</p>\n<p>In addition to taking advantage of credit monitoring, Equifax and consumer advocates suggested consumers consider several other steps to protect their credit right away: freezing their credit reports and placing a fraud alert on their reports.</p>\n<p>But what's the difference between these options? While each service has the same goal of protecting your identity and your credit, they all work differently and some may be better for some consumers than others.</p>\n<h3>Credit monitoring</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, credit monitoring is a service people pay for. With LifeLock, for example, you can pay a monthly fee to have the company continually check for fraud or threats to your financial accounts and credit reports. Other credit monitoring services work similarly, although they may offer different features.</p>\n<h3>Credit freeze</h3>\n<p>With a <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-freeze-your-credit?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit freeze</a>, you usually pay up to $10 per credit reporting agency to make your credit report inaccessible to lenders, thereby making it impossible for hackers and scammers to open new accounts in your name. Note that you usually also pay a fee every time you want to unfreeze your credit. For now, credit freezes and unfreezes are free with Equifax.</p>\n<h3>Fraud alerts</h3>\n<p>If you don't want to freeze your credit completely, you can place three different types of fraud alerts on your credit report instead. <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-get-a-free-fraud-alert-on-your-credit-report?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Fraud alerts</a> are free, and they require lenders to verify your identity before issuing new credit in your name. As the <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs#difference\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Trade Commission</a> notes, options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Initial fraud alert: This type of fraud alert is best for someone whose identity hasn't been stolen yet. It protects your credit from unverified access for up to 90 days.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Extended fraud alert: An extended fraud alert protects victims of identity theft for up to seven years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Active duty military alert: This alert protects active duty service members from identity theft for up to one year while they are on deployment.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Should you pay for credit monitoring?</h2>\n<p>Whether you should pay for credit monitoring depends on your situation. Gerri Detweiler, education director for Nav, a company that makes tools for managing business credit, says that while there are more opportunities than ever to monitor your credit for free, there are times when paying for a more comprehensive service could be advantageous. \"The monitoring on these platforms can be more robust,\" she says.</p>\n<p>If you know that you will not take the time to monitor your credit accounts yourself, or you just want the peace of mind of knowing someone else is doing it for you, then paying for a subscription service may be worth it.</p>\n<p>Freezing your credit report can also make sense, says Detweiler. But if you're doing it to prevent identity theft, you need to know the drawbacks. \"It can be a hassle when you go to apply for credit, insurance, or even try to get a new cellphone,\" says Detweiler, mostly because you will have to unfreeze your credit report any time you want to apply for new credit. That can get costly.</p>\n<p>Detweiler says she also worries that credit freezes create a false sense of security. While a freeze can prevent someone from opening new accounts in your name, it can't prevent hackers from using your existing accounts fraudulently or stealing your information.</p>\n<p>As far as fraud alerts go, Detweiler chose this option when she was a victim of identity theft in 2017. While a credit freeze locks down your new credit, fraud alerts allow creditors to access your credit report as long as they are able to verify your identity. For this reason, fraud alerts may be a better option for someone who opens new credit regularly and still wants some protection against identity theft.</p>\n<h2>Other ways to keep your credit safe</h2>\n<p>If you are preparing for a crucial loan like a mortgage, new auto loan, or small business loan, for example, you want to make sure your credit is as solid as possible, says Detweiler. That's because lower credit scores may mean you won't get approved for the loan or you'll pay more in interest charges.</p>\n<p>Plus, you'll want to keep your identity and personal information safe from hackers and scammers no matter what. If your identity is stolen, it can take months or even years to get the situation cleared up.</p>\n<p>Detweiler says you should take advantage of the fact that you can get a free copy of your credit report from the three credit reporting agencies — Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion — once per year at <a href=\"http://www.annualcreditreport.com\" target=\"_blank\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. By accessing your full credit report regularly, you can check for errors or fraudulent activity and report them immediately if you find them. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-read-a-credit-report?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Read a Credit Report</a>)</p>\n<p>There are also plenty of places where you can get a free credit score. Many credit card issuers give out <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/best-credit-cards-that-offer-free-credit-scores?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">free credit scores</a>. Other free services such as Credit Karma give you an estimate of your credit score year-round and set up notifications to let you know when a new account is opened in your name.</p>\n<p>Trevor Buxton, Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) and assistant vice president of fraud prevention at PNC Bank also suggests the following actions to keep your credit safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Keep a close eye on your bank accounts. \"If you notice unauthorized activity on your account, immediately call the number on the back of your debit, ATM, or credit card, or stop by your local branch,\" says Buxton.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sign up for alerts on your accounts. Many banks let you set up your credit and debit accounts so you're notified any time a purchase is made.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spread your free credit reports over the course of a year. Since you can get a free report from the three credit reporting agencies once per year, Buxton suggests spreading those out by accessing one free report every four months.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notify credit reporting agencies of any false reporting. If you find any errors on your credit report, notify the credit reporting agency in question and dispute the information right away. You can find out more about how to dispute errors on your credit report on <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0151-disputing-errors-credit-reports\" target=\"_blank\">the FTC website</a>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Cardboard boxes and any containers you have sitting around the house will suffice for sorting items. But professional organizers know that there are certain containers, shelves, and gadgets that can make the job of decluttering easier. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-smart-ways-to-keep-your-entire-life-clutter-free?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Smart Ways to Keep Your Entire Life Clutter-Free</a>)</p>\n<p>Besides, having a shiny new toy or two just might incentivize you to finally get to work on your decluttering project. Here are some top storage picks from the pros.</p>\n<h2>1. Paper sorter for container lids</h2>\n<p>I'm one of those cooks who saves every scrap of leftovers, no matter how small; so of course I have a million plastic and glass storage containers in my kitchen — and <em>of</em> <em>course</em> I have trouble corralling all those lids and keeping them in order. I was intrigued when I read on the <a href=\"http://bneatobar.com/the-tupperware-search-party/\" target=\"_blank\">Bneato Bar blog</a> that a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2I8Nn0j\" target=\"_blank\">paper sorter</a> — normally found in offices — could be helpful the kitchen for keeping container lids accessible and visible in a drawer when placed on its side. I'll try it!</p>\n<h2>2. Lazy Susan</h2>\n<p>Raise your hand if you think we need a gender-neutral term for this incredibly useful device. Maybe I'll just start calling it a Lazy Sam. At any rate, put these <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2I3rUKj\" target=\"_blank\">rotating trays</a> in your pantry and cabinets.</p>\n<p>\"Instead of letting the oils and vinegars that fall to the back disappear, it keeps everything accessible because it spins!\" says professional organizer and blogger Tova Weinstock, aka Tidy Tova.</p>\n<h2>3. Linus clear open storage bins</h2>\n<p>These open-topped, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rtHeWj\" target=\"_blank\">stackable bins with built-in handles</a> by InterDesign are marketed as a bathroom organizer, but founder of Gotham Organizers, Lisa Zaslow, recommends them for every room and closet in the house.</p>\n<p>\"They come in a variety of sizes and make it super easy to group similar things together — one of the golden rules of organizing,\" Zaslow says. \"Because they're sturdy and easy to clean, they're particularly great for things that can spill or are sticky.\"</p>\n<p>Weinstock also recommends clear Linus bins, especially for the pantry.</p>\n<p>\"I love these for keeping like-items contained (think: baking supplies) so you know where things are and don't end up buying multiples,\" Weinstock says.</p>\n<h2>4. 3-tiered mesh tray</h2>\n<p>Founder of Chicago-based organizing service Organizing With You, Inc., Pooja Naik recommends a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Iv7OrI\" target=\"_blank\">tiered mesh tray</a> for taming desktop clutter by organizing papers that need attention into categories. It may seem obvious, but, she explains, it helps you get that first step of organizing done, clearing the surface, which then gives you more workspace to tackle the next task.</p>\n<h2>5. NEET zippered cable tie</h2>\n<p>With a video-gamer husband and three children who all have their own personal devices, I live in a cable nightmare. Charging cords dangle and sprawl all over my house, making areas that should be calm — like my bedroom — feel chaotic.</p>\n<p>Professional organizer and blogger Cary Prince found a product that just might solve my problem at the National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO) conference (yes, that's a thing). These <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KKyRh7\" target=\"_blank\">zippered cable ties by NEET</a> are like little coats that zip around your cables, from skinny earbud wires to fat bunches of coaxial cables.</p>\n<p>At home, they can gather together messes of cables and keep them from getting coated with dust. In a purse or suitcase, they provide a convenient way to wrap up and contain cords so they don't get tangled.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. MOS magnetic cable organizer</h2>\n<p>Another idea for reining in cord chaos is this chic <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2I8URAF\" target=\"_blank\">magnetic cable organizer</a> by MOS, which can be mounted on a wall or placed on a desktop. It comes with magnetic blue cable clips to attach cables to its surface. Founder and president of Mindful Decluttering &amp; Organizing, Pam Holland, included this item in her list of favorite organizing products, explaining, \"This attractive magnetic pad makes it easy to keep those unruly electronic cables in one place and untangled.\" (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-easy-ways-to-declutter-your-digital-life?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Easy Ways to Declutter Your Digital Life</a>)</p>\n<h2>7. Mesh stacking shoe shelves</h2>\n<p>More than one organizer I spoke with agreed that shoe racks or shelves are a must for preventing pileups. Zaslow swears by this <a href=\"https://www.containerstore.com/s/white-mesh-stackable-shoe-shelf/d?productId=10015028&amp;q=mesh%20shoe%20shelf\" target=\"_blank\">white mesh shoe shelf</a> from The Container Store.</p>\n<p>\"The mesh keeps heels from falling through the shelf, and you can quickly stack them up to store many pairs of shoes in a small 'footprint' — no tools needed. They are super minimal so you barely see them, but they're really strong, unlike some other flimsy shoe shelves,\" Zaslow says.</p>\n<h2>8. Command hooks</h2>\n<p>Lack of adequate hooks for hanging things is often a frustration for me, especially since I'm not handy with a drill. Zaslow solves this problem by using easy-to-apply <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2woHY49\" target=\"_blank\">Command hooks</a>, which come in a variety of sizes.</p>\n<p>\"There endless ways to use them: hang mops and brooms inside of a closet, create a spot for kids' backpacks near the front door, hang your blow dryer on the side of your vanity, or store oven mitts inside the door of a low cabinet near the stove,\" Zaslow says.</p>\n<h2>9. Stackable shelf organizer</h2>\n<p>Ideally, your kitchen would have shelves at the perfect heights to store all of your dishes and glasses, with no big gaps of wasted space between shelves. But why wait until you have the ideal kitchen before you start organizing, when you can maximize the space in the cupboards you have now?

These days, more and more people are using the web to research destinations, plan itineraries, and book their own hotels.</p>\n<p>The freedom to research independently is a good thing, but there's also a problem: The American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA) reports that 55 million hotel booking scams are perpetrated against unsuspecting consumers each year.</p>\n<p>The organization acknowledges that the internet has offered great conveniences in the travel space, but says hotel booking scams continue popping up all the time. Rogue third-party online booking sites imitate legitimate hotel websites, taking advantage of the huge volume of online travel searches. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/this-airbnb-scam-will-ruin-your-vacation-and-your-budget?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">This Airbnb Scam Will Ruin Your Vacation — and Your Budget</a>)</p>\n<h2>The anatomy of a hotel booking scam</h2>\n<p>According to the AHLA, many hotel booking scams are set up so consumers don't even know they've been tricked. Most of the time, it starts with a hotel scam website being created and promoted so that it shows up in internet search engines right alongside legitimate hotel websites and third-party booking sites.</p>\n<p>\"These rogue sites trick consumers by mirroring the look and feel of the actual hotel website — using copyrighted images, trademarked logos, and many times, even similar URLs — to take consumers for a ride,\" writes the AHLA in a report about online booking scams.</p>\n<p>From there, the fraud committed can take on several different forms. The fraudulent website may steal the victim's money completely without making a hotel reservation on their behalf. Or it might charge the consumer an inflated rate that includes a giant commission the consumer shouldn't have to pay.</p>\n<p>At the very least, you may miss out on hotel loyalty points or perks you thought you were going to receive if you believed you were making a reservation directly with a hotel.</p>\n<h2>How to avoid hotel booking scams</h2>\n<p>The AHLA has partnered with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to raise awareness about hotel booking scams with the goal of protecting consumers. According to Beverly Baskin, CEO of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, certain types of consumers are especially at risk for these scams, including travelers ages 55 and up and members of the military. Baskin says that travel and vacation scams cost the average victim around $847.</p>\n<p>If you're eager to ensure your travel plans aren't ruined by thieves, consider these tips from the BBB and the AHLA:</p>\n<h3>Book directly with the source</h3>\n<p>Before you book a hotel stay online, make sure you are booking on the hotel's website. While a lookalike hotel website may have the hotel's name in their URL, double check the website address to endure it's not a third-party website trying to steal a hotel's identity.</p>\n<p>If you're booking with a large hotel chain, one way to do this is to visit the chain's website and make your reservation from there. If you're booking the Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik Hotel in Croatia, for example, go to Hilton.com and book your reservation on the main hotel website.</p>\n<p>If you do an internet search for \"Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik,\" you will see several lookalike sites like this one:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You should avoid these third-party imposters at all costs.</p>\n<h3>Use reputable third-party websites</h3>\n<p>It's OK to use third-party websites like Expedia, Travelocity, and Priceline. Legitimate <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-hotel-booking-websites-can-save-you-money-and-headaches?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hotel booking sites can save you money</a> and headaches. But you should beware of thirty-party booking sites you have never heard of. The BBB says you should never trust a website just because it looks legitimate. Take the extra step to check the company out with BBB.org and read online reviews before you book.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Take advantage of hotel loyalty programs</h3>\n<p>If you're someone who likes staying with the big hotel chains (e.g. Hilton, Marriott, IHG Rewards, etc.), it makes sense to sign up for the related <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/breakdown-of-benefits-and-value-of-the-best-hotel-rewards-programs-and-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hotel loyalty program</a>. These programs are free to join and they typically offer the lowest rates to loyalty members who book direct.</p>\n<p>Not only will you have a secure loyalty account you can make your bookings through, but hotel loyalty programs let you earn points for free hotel stays, <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/easy-ways-to-get-elite-status-for-free-hotel-upgrades?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hotel room upgrades</a>, and more. Some <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-best-credit-cards-for-hotel-deals-and-rewards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hotel credit cards</a> also let you earn large <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-best-credit-cards-with-sign-up-bonuses-for-hotel-stays?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">sign-up bonuses for hotel rewards programs</a>, which make it easier for you to rack up enough points for free rooms quickly. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-best-credit-cards-for-hotel-deals-and-rewards?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Best Credit Cards for Hotel Deals and Rewards</a>)</p>\n<h3>Pay for your hotel with a credit card</h3>\n<p>Using a credit card is one of the most secure ways to make any online purchase, mostly because credit cards come with zero percent liability for fraudulent charges. If you find you are the victim of a travel scam or hotel booking scam where they kept your money without making a hotel reservation, you can <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-awesome-credit-card-tricks-that-will-save-you-money?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">ask for a \"chargeback\"</a> on your account and get a refund. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-win-a-fraud-dispute-with-your-credit-card-company?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Win a Fraud Dispute With Your Credit Card Company</a>)</p>\n<h3>Keep your eyes wide open</h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to avoid becoming the victim of a travel scam is to know what to look for. The BBB says you should avoid conducting internet searches for broad terms like \"best travel deals\" or \"cheapest rates\" since those type of searches tend to bring out the worst offenders among lookalike travel websites.</p>\n<p>If something seems off, the BBB says you should call the hotel and ask plenty of questions.</p>\n<h3>Make sure you know the hotel's refund policy</h3>\n<p>The BBB says you should read all the fine print before you agree to a hotel charge being placed on your credit card. Will you need to pay upfront, for example? Or will your card be charged upon arrival? Is the hotel booking refundable if you need to cancel for any reason?</p>\n<p>While some big hotel chains and legitimate third-party booking websites offer discounts for non-refundable fares, it's more common for hotels to use your credit card to secure the reservation but wait to charge the rate until your hotel stay is completed. Hotel cancellation policies vary by chain, however, so make sure you know the policy ahead of time.</p>\n<h3>Plan ahead</h3>\n<p>Last but not least, you may get the best price on your hotel stay and other travel arrangements if you book far in advance. Planning ahead will also give you time to compare options, research hotel booking websites, and lock in a good rate.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a last-minute, hasty search for a hotel may put you at greater risk for encountering a scam and losing money.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

But very few people actually have the means to take the plunge and make it happen. One of the most common reasons for staying put is not having enough money to satisfy that wanderlust. However, most of us have a ready-made travel fund at our disposal in the numerous possessions that we own.</p>\n<p>One of the quickest and easiest methods of committing to a life of travel and being able to afford it without years of saving is to sell everything you own. Here's how to do it.

For most people, the thought of getting rid of things that they've had for years and formed emotional attachments to can cause serious distress.</p>\n<p>However, if you're ready to embark on this adventure, you'll need to get into the mindset of valuing experiences over physical possessions. A great method for doing this is to find a way to remind yourself of exactly why you're doing this and the amazing memories it's going to pay for. Selling that beloved car that you'd dreamed about owning for years? That's potentially six months' worth of accommodation costs paid for. Getting rid of a childhood toy that was a birthday gift from your parents and has now become a collectors' item? That could pay for a delicious meal out.</p>\n<p>You can find a million reasons to set aside stuff that you don't want to sell, but once you start down that path, it's difficult to stop. Mentally detaching yourself from your possessions can be gut-wrenching, but once it's done, you'll feel free of all that material baggage and ready for a new chapter.

Go through your digital and hard-copy photos from previous trips, or read an inspirational travel blog every day. Whatever it is, find a way to maintain that sightseeing excitement when you start feeling blue.

Make an inventory list for everything you have, either in a notepad, or in a spreadsheet so it's easy to search and edit. This will also come in handy for tracking what's sold and for how much.</p>\n<p>Once everything is on the inventory list, price each item by checking eBay and Craigslist to see how much similar items are going for. This will take some time, but will be worth it to ensure you're getting market value and not letting things go too cheaply or expecting way too much.</p>\n<h2>Set a date</h2>\n<p>Once your items are priced and ready to go, it's important to quit procrastinating and just start selling. The best way to jolt yourself into action is to set a date when you're going to have everything sold by. The longer you wait to start, the easier it is to talk yourself out of selling certain items, and the harder it will be to actually let everything go.</p>\n<p>Be realistic when you're setting the date and take into account how long it's going to take to put your possessions up for sale, plus the amount of time it may take before they’re actually sold. Not everything will be snapped up right away, and even some extremely valuable items may take a long time to get rid of. Allow yourself at least a few weeks, but ideally, a number of months to get everything sold.</p>\n<p>You can also set a target for how much you want to make from selling everything and break it down into a weekly target. This way you can work toward it in increments and maintain your focus by just doing a little bit each day.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Use the right platforms</h2>\n<p>To maximize the amount of money you're recouping for each item, it's important to choose the right platform to sell it on. Though it may take more time to do it this way, it will ensure you receive the best value for your belongings.</p>\n<h3>eBay</h3>\n<p>This site is great for collectibles or other small items that have a decent value. For these items, it's best to use the auction function in the hope that you spark a bidding war between interested parties, driving the price up.</p>\n<p>Don't be tempted to just throw a bad picture up there and a two-word description of the item. The more effort you put in, the more attractive you can make things look. Put a bit of time into writing brand names, captions, and taking photos that show items in their best light.

That’s why Craigslist is a great option for these item. Think furniture and bulky items like TVs.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> When buyers come to collect, take the opportunity to show them your other stuff and ask if they're on the lookout for anything else. You may be surprised at how many extra sales you make this way.</p>\n<h3>Yard sales</h3>\n<p>Remember, one person's junk is another person's treasure. Because of this, even the odd bits and pieces that you may not think would sell might earn you a few dollars or more in the right setting. Yard and garage sales are great for these kinds of items, because in my experience, they're often attended by people looking for unusual objects.

She made doll houses, and was interested in objects that would be suitable to furnish them, and was willing to pay for items that probably wouldn't have sold elsewhere.</p>\n<h3>Facebook Marketplace</h3>\n<p>Facebook Marketplace can be a great tool for selling specialist items, and items to people who live nearby. You have to have a Facebook account in order to use this part of the platform, and you can include photos, the price you're offering the item for, and any additional details. Interested buyers can contact you via direct message to inquire if the item is still available, or ask questions. You don't need to be Facebook friends in order to connect with potential buyers.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Credit expert John Ulzheimer says it's just like teaching your teenager how to operate a car, but in a controlled environment. \"Nobody would just let a teen hop in a car and drive,\" says Ulzheimer, who formerly worked with Equifax and FICO. \"And nobody should just let their kid get a card on their own someday without some teaching by the parents.\"</p>\n<p>Yet, that is exactly what many people do. The problem is, for a teen, a credit card may seem \"no different from using a gift card or some other stored-value card,\" says Ulzheimer. And that can be dangerous. If they charge more than they can afford to repay, they might wind up dealing with years of debt and regret.</p>\n<p>The reality is that your child will need credit to borrow money one day. If they don't build a solid credit history during high school or college, they may start their adult lives at a disadvantage. \"Helping your teenager build their credit can make their life easier in the future when they go to purchase a big-ticket item on a line of credit, like a vehicle or home,\" says Gina McKague, president and CEO of retirement planning firm McKague Financial.</p>\n<p>And while some financial experts like Dave Ramsey insist that nobody needs a credit score to get by in life, many argue that thinking is outdated. The reality is, <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-life-is-better-with-good-credit?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">good credit improves your life significantly</a>. \"Not only is establishing credit vital for obtaining something significant like a loan, but as more and more vendors exclusively accept payments via credit cards or even smartphones, it can be necessary just for buying lunch,\" says Jeff Motske, financial planner and CEO of Trilogy Financial in Huntington Beach, California.</p>\n<p>Besides lenders, everyone from car insurance companies, to landlords, to employers can ask for modified versions of your credit report. They can influence your ability to get a job, an apartment, or good car insurance rates. If those aren't reasons enough to get your teen on the right track with responsible credit use, what is?</p>\n<h2>How to get your teenager a credit card</h2>\n<p>Ulzheimer says there are several ways to know if your child is ready to learn about credit. If they're already using debit cards, prepaid cards, or their phone to make purchases with your credit card information, then they're probably ready to get a credit card with your help, he says. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/8-best-sites-to-help-your-kids-learn-about-money?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Websites to Help Your Kids Learn About Money</a>)</p>\n<p>Still not sure? A teenager's senior year in high school is often a good time to start. \"That way, they're as mature as possible while still living under your roof,\" notes Ulzheimer.</p>\n<p>Once your kid is primed and ready, the best way to introduce them to credit is by <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-reasons-to-add-your-teen-as-an-authorized-user-on-your-credit-card?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">adding them as an authorized user</a> to your own credit card account. Doing so comes with several advantages, including the fact that your own positive credit movements will be reported to your teenager's credit report. Not only that, but you will receive the bill, so you can keep tabs on their activity. Just be aware that you and you alone are responsible for repaying every charge your teenager makes.</p>\n<p>Ulzheimer suggests teaching your kids to use credit cards only for purchases they were going to make anyway, such as gas or movies. If they have a job, you can even require that they make payments from their own money, he says.</p>\n<p>This should be easy to do even though you're the one receiving the bill. When your statement arrives in the mail or via email, simply tally up your child's purchases and let them know what they owe. Ideally, they will also keep a record of what they paid for with credit and have the money saved to pay their share of the bill — just like in the real world.</p>\n<p>And if you're worried your teen will fall into some bad credit habits right away, Ulzheimer suggests setting up text alerts so you know exactly when the card is being used. This way, \"you can make sure they're not using the card outside the boundaries you set,\" he says.

For example, explain what expenses the card should be used for, how long the funds on the card should last, and what criteria would cause you to revoke the prepaid card.</p>\n<p>Many prepaid debit cards, such as the Current Card, are geared toward teens. The Current Card runs on the Visa system, so it's accepted at most merchants. Like any other prepaid debit card, you have to load funds into the account before it can be used. But the Current Card also offers enhanced features that help kids budget their money, save for a rainy day, and donate to charity. Parents are able to manage and oversee the teen's purchases with a mobile app and add money to their accounts instantly.</p>\n<p>A regular debit card tied to a bank account can also be a good way to get the ball rolling, or it can be a transition tool between a prepaid card and a credit card. You may even want to link it to the child's own bank account, so they can only use money that's given to them or that they earn from chores or a job.</p>\n<p>Eventually, however, you want to introduce them to credit cards by adding them as an authorized user to your account. Ideally, you'll want to do this before they leave the nest and wind up dabbling with credit on their own. \"Be sure to establish a new set of ground rules with the new card, including the familial and financial consequences of not following those rules,\" advises Motske.</p>\n<p>The idea of giving your teenager a credit card may be the stuff of nightmares. But it could be even scarier to imagine them learning about credit through the school of hard knocks — by racking up a huge mountain of debt or ruining their credit score by not paying their bills.

Some of the most memorable headlines in the past few years have even gone viral, giving the animals in question an instant dose of fame. There was the woman who caused a stir trying to board a flight with a fully grown peacock at Newark Airport, and a pig named Hobie who was ejected after boarding for defecating on the plane.</p>\n<p>But behind all the bizarre headlines, there's a lingering concern of how to safely travel on a plane with your pet. There are a number of possibilities for animal lovers and their companions to travel together, though the specifics tend to vary from airline to airline, and your destination will have a big impact on it, too. Here's what you need to know before heading to the airport with Fido.</p>\n<h2>Check with the airline before booking</h2>\n<p>Many carriers, particularly on flights departing and arriving within the U.S. and its overseas territories, do allow you to bring animals onboard with you. Domesticated dogs and cats (and sometimes small birds) will be allowed on, though there is usually an extra fee attached, and there's a limit on the total number of pets per flight. For example, American Airlines charges $125 per carry-on pet. Larger animals will typically need to be boarded with cargo underneath the plane.</p>\n<p>Each airline has its own rules about the size, weight, and breed of animal you are permitted to travel with, as well as specific guidelines on how they are to be transported. Because of this, it's best to check directly with your intended airline before booking the flight. Generally, they must be small enough to fit underneath your seat in a carrier that's large enough for them to turn around in.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Certify your pet as an Emotional Support Animal</h2>\n<p>If taking your pet onboard with you is a medical requirement — for example, if you've been diagnosed with depression or anxiety — then you should consider getting it classified as an Emotional Support Animal (ESA). If this is the case, and the animal in question helps alleviate symptoms, then you can legitimately get your pet designated as your ESA. Keep in mind, this is not a quick fix or workaround and should only be used in genuine circumstances.</p>\n<p>In order to have your pet certified as an ESA, you'll need to get a letter from a mental health professional. This letter will need to detail your condition, testify to the fact that you are a patient under their care, include the name of your pet, and explain how the pet helps you. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-make-your-pet-an-official-emotional-support-animal?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Make Your Pet an Official Emotional Support Animal</a>)</p>\n<p>Several sites allow you to purchase these kinds of letters online for a fee, with very little process and without ever meeting a medical professional, but many of these services are not legitimate and the letter they provide will not be deemed valid.</p>\n<p>Once you have secured this letter, you're good to go and need to carry it with you to show to the airline crew before boarding. Letters are valid for a year, so they need to be dated when they are issued.</p>\n<h2>Head to the airport early</h2>\n<p>The most important step to take when flying with a pet is to contact the airline well in advance to inform them of your plans. This applies whether it's an ESA or not, so you can avoid any nasty surprises that may prevent you from being able to catch your flight.</p>\n<p>On the day of travel, you should arrive early to the airport to allow yourself time to sort out any issues that may arise. Your airline may want to check paperwork; examine, weigh, and measure the pet; or check that the crate or carry case meets their specifications. Animal spots on planes are also often provided on a first come first serve basis, and while it's unlikely that there will be several other pets onboard, it's not worth taking the risk.

It can be stressful for the dogs, and there have been numerous incidences of animals being lost, injured due to turbulence, or dying due to extreme temperature fluctuations. However, many planes that carry pets keep their luggage compartment pressurized and climate-controlled, as a way to keep pets in the cargo hold more comfortable.</p>\n<p>It's also not free, and the fee attached might be more than the fee to take the pet onboard with you. For larger dogs, you may have no other choice than to put them in the cargo hold. But for smaller pets, it’s a good idea to check fees before you decide which way to take your pet.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Millennials, in particular, are making money in ways that weren't possible just five or 10 years ago. Entire professions have sprung up that allow savvy entrepreneurs to cash in while actually working less than if they had a regular full-time job.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of articles out there claiming to show you how easy it is to make millions with very little work. I want to stress that generally this simply isn't the case, and there are no legitimate \"get rich quick schemes\" on the internet. All of these jobs, even the ones that will eventually provide you with passive income, take a lot of work and dedication to get right, especially at the start.</p>\n<p>However, with a bit of know-how and a lot of dedication, it's possible to break free from a life chained to your cubicle working 60 hours a week. Millennials have been at the forefront of the latest developments on the internet, and are continually inventing new ways to earn a living through it. Here are six ways millennials are working less and earning more.</p>\n<h2>1. Cryptocurrency</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency has been constantly in the news recently, with analysts and skeptics regularly predicting that it's on the verge of suffering a huge crash. Despite all the doom and gloom surrounding it, and some recent volatility, there are still plenty of people making money from it. There are also many different ways that people can use <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/what-is-cryptocurrency-anyway?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrency</a> to make money, meaning it's a versatile income stream. Essentially, cryptocurrency is a digital asset that uses cryptography as a security measure. Bitcoin is one form of cryptocurrency that has been in the spotlight quite a bit. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/is-bitcoin-still-a-thing?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Is Bitcoin Still a Thing?</a>)</p>\n<p>Simon Yu, CEO of blockchain startup StormX told Forbes, \"Millennials are particularly open to embracing new technology in order to create opportunities for themselves — and blockchain, the tech behind crypto, is no different. As masters of the side hustle and challengers of the traditional 9–5 working lives of previous generations, millennials are welcoming blockchain with open arms.\"</p>\n<p>Trading is probably the most well-known method of making money from cryptocurrency, but by no means the only one. Those with an in-depth knowledge of computers can actually mine cryptocurrency, although profits from this are far lower than they were previously. Buying and holding your chosen cryptocurrency is also a popular way to make profits. Rising values have sparked hundreds of stories about how early investors got rich by cashing out their holdings once their value had soared.</p>\n<h2>2. Online trading</h2>\n<p>Where trading stocks used to be relatively complicated to get into, the internet has opened it up to virtually anyone. Trading in the stock market can be a great way to make money online, and you need little more than a laptop or smartphone and an internet connection to get going. By being supremely tech-savvy and learning to trade via apps, millennials are getting more and more involved in the stock trading scene.

To get going, open a brokerage account with a reputable stock broker, and then it's a case of finding the right stock that will bring you profits. It's important to know that stock trading always carries a risk, but there are lots of people doing it remotely, millennials in particular, and making it work.

Drop shipping</h2>\n<p>Drop shipping allows people to create online stores and fulfill their orders without ever having to actually handle the inventory themselves. The orders are fulfilled either directly by the manufacturer, or another third party, freeing up the seller to concentrate solely on attracting new customers and selling products. There's no need for warehouses full of stock and you don't have to deal with postage and packaging, so you can set up and operate with extremely low operating costs.</p>\n<p>Once a store is set up and running, it can take minimal effort to keep it going. Sites like <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AliExpress</a> have been specifically created for the purposes of connecting dropshippers with manufacturers, and they make the process even simpler because you don't need to source manufacturers yourself. This type of retail suits marketing- and sales-driven individuals who don't want to be bogged down by the manufacturing and delivery fulfillment aspect of running online stores.</p>\n<p>This trend has become particularly popular among millennials and Gen Z'ers because of internet marketing skills that have grown naturally over a lifetime of use, and it requires little in startup funds to get going.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Blogging</h2>\n<p>With a few minutes and a minimal amount of cash upfront, it's easy to set up your very own blog. Taking it to the next level and monetizing it will take longer, but it's possible to see a decent return on your investment within a matter of months. One of the most important steps is choosing a profitable niche, preferably one that you're already knowledgeable and passionate about so you can write about your subject with authority and enthusiasm right off the bat.</p>\n<p>Once you've built up an audience, there are lots of income streams open to bloggers. Savvy bloggers also create numerous blogs simultaneously to maximize income. Popular moneymaking methods include: recommending products or services to your audience and receiving payments for affiliate sales, advertising on your blog, and creating and selling your own products, like e-books and podcasts.</p>\n<p>Because of they’ve grown up creating content on social media and microblogging platforms like Tumblr, millennials are generally savvy when it comes to creating blogs, building their networks, and nurturing those digital relationships to ensure their content is shared by as many people as possible.

Online stores</h2>\n<p>Forget about renting space, filling it with products, and waiting around for customers to wander in. Online retail shops allow you to set up digitally with minimal upfront costs, and countless ways to actively drive paying customers to your store. Online stores have become big business, particularly with millennials and the rise of smartphones putting products in customers' hands 24/7.</p>\n<p>Setting up is simple thanks to sites like Shopify or Woocommerce, which have easy-to-use templates and models that can get your online store ready to go in minutes. You can sell products you already have, or look for products to sell on both sites. If selling crafty items is more your style, you can create storefronts on Amazon Handmade or Etsy. It's then a case of promoting these stores and their products online using social media platforms.

Ads management</h2>\n<p>Helping companies unlock the potential of online advertising to increase their reach, and ultimately their profits, has gotten more popular in recent years. Since search engines and social media platforms turn to advertising as their main source of revenue, it has opened up endless possibilities. Facebook advertising, in particular, has become a popular way for people to make money through selling ad management services. It's possible to produce extremely targeted advertisements to a specific audience using the data they collect.</p>\n<p>Many businesses are completely unaware of how to use online advertising, and local companies potentially may not even have an online presence, making it relatively easy to sell to them. For a monthly retainer they receive guaranteed, quality customer referrals looking to purchase their services or products.</p>\n<p>Millennials are perfect for gigs like this, as they spend so much time on social media anyway, and have an intimate knowledge of what they and their peers connect to in terms of content.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Though phone plans have improved considerably over the past few years — with carriers making international access a key part of their services — using your phone abroad can still be costly. There are also massive differences between what each company offers, and it can be difficult to determine which one to select if you spend a lot of time on the road. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/8-ways-to-save-on-smartphone-costs-while-traveling?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Ways to Save on Smartphone Costs While Traveling</a>)</p>\n<p>To save you from running up unforeseen bills on your travels, check out these five phone plans that offer cheaper roaming charges.</p>\n<h2>1. AT&amp;T International Day Pass</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.att.com/offers/international-plans/day-pass.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Day Pass</a> from AT&amp;T allows you to take your existing plan with you on the road so you're able to use your data, minutes, and text message allowance. It covers you in over 100 countries, is easily activated online or by calling them, and once it's added to your device, it stays there ready to go for each time you head abroad.</p>\n<p>To qualify for the International Day Pass, you need to have a Mobile Share Plan or the AT&amp;T Unlimited Plan. Conveniently, you only pay the $10 daily fee on the days that you actually use your package, rather than for each day you're abroad.</p>\n<h2>2. T-Mobile One Plan</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/optional-services/roaming.html\" target=\"_blank\">T-Mobile's One Plan</a> aims to be the simplest, most transparent plan on the market and this objective remains the same when it comes to taking it abroad. There's no need to change any settings on your account before your trip because international roaming comes as standard.</p>\n<p>You're able to use your unlimited data in over 140 countries, but only with speeds of up to 128 kbps. This is fine for browsing the web or checking emails but no good for streaming or downloads. If you need higher speeds, you can upgrade to the One Plus plan for $10 per month to get 256 kbps. Texting is also free with the plan. Depending on how many lines you have, prices T-Mobile plans can be as low as $40 per month.</p>\n<h2>3. Sprint Global Roaming</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.sprint.com/en/shop/services/global-roaming.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sprint Global Roaming</a>, international roaming coverage is enabled at no extra cost in more than 200 countries. In 165 destinations that are deemed \"low service areas,\" the package also includes free texts, free data and low-speed data, and calls at just 20 cents per minute. It should be automatically configured on your smartphone without you having to do anything, so you can simply up and go whenever you want without having to worry about changing your package.</p>\n<p>The service supports data speeds of up to 2G, which is good enough for basic web usage and things like map navigation, but won't cope with streaming or downloading. If you're a heavy user or need quicker speeds, Sprint has high speed data add-ons that will give you speeds up to LTE. In most destinations the cost will be $5 per day or $25 per week, and you can add this service even if you're already abroad. Sprint's basic plans start at $40–$60 per month.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Verizon Travel Pass</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.verizonwireless.com/solutions-and-services/international-travel/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon's Travel Pass plan</a> is virtually identical to the AT&amp;T International Day Pass, allowing you to take your existing plan with you to over 130 countries for a daily fee. In Mexico and Canada, you'll pay an additional $5 per day, and $10 per day in other countries. You'll be able to use your talk, text, and data.</p>\n<p>You only pay for the days that you actually use the service, and not for each day that you're abroad. Verizon's regular unlimited plans come in at $75 per month for a single line and go as low as $40 per line ($160 per month) if you have four lines.</p>\n<h2>5. Google Project Fi</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fi.google.com/about/plan/\" target=\"_blank\">Google's Project Fi</a> virtual network came up with a unique way of pricing its plan to give people the ability to only pay for what they use. You pay a flat rate of $20 per month for text and calls, then you pay $10 per GB of data that you use. The plan's simplicity means that it remains exactly the same providing you're in one of the 170+ destinations where they provide coverage.</p>\n<p>One thing to note with Project Fi is that you have an extremely limited number of phones to choose from that are compatible with the network.</p>\n<h2>Alternatives to using mobile roaming data</h2>\n<p>Regardless of which provider you choose, there are pros and cons to using your data package abroad. However, to keep the costs down, there are ways to reduce your time spent using roaming data. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/technology-hacks-for-the-international-traveler?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Technology Hacks for the International Traveler</a>)</p>\n<h3>Buy a local sim card</h3>\n<p>Depending on where you go, local sims are often the cheapest way to get data at a far lower price. Having used these all over the world, in my experience, they usually range in price from absolutely free to around $10. You can then access local prepaid rates that tend to be cheaper than international roaming rates.</p>\n<h3>Stick to Wi-Fi</h3>\n<p>Wi-Fi hot spots are available virtually everywhere, many are free of charge, and they can also provide quicker speeds than cellular data services. If you're able to save your online activity for when you're in range of one, or at your hotel or in a coffee shop with Wi-Fi, you'll save even more.</p>\n<h3>Extend your data</h3>\n<p>There are lots of apps available that help to extend your data by compressing it, so you use less than you ordinarily would. Many apps also have options in their settings to compress their data usage, including the Chrome browser, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>\n<h3>Turn off background data usage</h3>\n<p>Lots of apps use your data even when they're not actually being used, which can lead to those unexpected, and unbelievably high bills upon returning home. Your process to restrict or turn off background data usage depends on what model of phone you have. You can ordinarily do this in settings or on specific apps.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Violence, wars, terrorism, and drugs can all destroy a country's image and leave lasting negative consequences for its tourism industry.</p>\n<p>But if you're looking for a budget vacation that's a little out of the ordinary, then consider exploring countries that for one reason or another haven't always enjoyed the best of reputations. Here are four affordable destinations that are actually less dangerous than you might think.

Up to a million people are estimated to have been killed during the unrest and the genocide that followed. Though this war ended over 20 years ago, for many it's still the first thing that springs to mind when Rwanda is mentioned, deterring some potential visitors.</p>\n<p>Today, the landscape in Rwanda is very different, and though the scars remain, it's beginning to build a reputation as one of the continent's finest tourist destinations. It's now widely regarded as one of the safest and most politically stable countries in Africa. At the time of publishing, the U.S. State Department rates it as having the lowest possible travel advisory level, with no current security alerts.</p>\n<p>Despite its diminutive size, it packs a punch far above its weight in terms of attractions. Known as \"The Land of a Thousand Hills,\" its undulating terrain is home to some incredible scenery and rare animals. This includes the famous National Volcanoes Park where you'll find some of the world's last remaining mountain gorillas.</p>\n<p>Rwanda is also rated as one of the most affordable countries to visit in the region. A meal at an inexpensive restaurant will set you back just $2.88, and a room in a budget hotel will start at around $30 depending on which area you're in.</p>\n<h2>Morocco</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>North Africa has developed a less than stellar reputation in recent years having been blighted by numerous acts of horrific terrorism. Morocco has also experienced terrorist-related incidents in the past, and it should be pointed out that the U.S. State Department says that \"the potential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens exists.\"</p>\n<p>However, the State Department’s travel advisory level for Morocco is currently at level 1, the lowest possible level, and there have not been any terrorist attacks in Morocco since 2011. It's widely considered one of the safest countries in the region and its continued high levels of tourism bear testament to this.</p>\n<p>Exquisite architecture intricately decorated with tiled mosaics, bustling marketplaces full of vibrantly colored spices and fabrics, and swathes of sand dunes stretching out for miles on end are just some of the reasons to visit Morocco. The cuisine is also a huge draw, with richly spiced dishes mixing sweet and savory to mouth watering effect.</p>\n<p>Thanks in part to the large numbers of tourists it receives, Morocco is one of the most reasonably priced countries in the region. Budget rooms are available starting at around $30 and a meal at an inexpensive restaurant will cost a little more than $3.</p>\n<h2>Colombia</h2>\n<p></p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>The shadow cast by drug kingpins like the notorious Pablo Escobar still lingers over Colombia, and these associations have proved difficult for the South American country to eliminate. Potential visitors still sometimes fear accidentally getting caught up in the drug trade, being kidnapped by guerrilla fighters, and becoming the victim of organized gang violence. This hasn't been helped by the recent release of popular movies and TV series on the subject.</p>\n<p>While these fears would have been well founded in the '80s and '90s, Colombia has worked hard to free itself from the clutches of organized crime. In the process, it's begun reinventing itself as a favored tourist destination for travelers wanting a taste of this previously unexplored South American country.</p>\n<p>Colombia has an attractive mixture of cutting edge modernity and a diverse range of breathtaking, untouched landscapes. This is showcased in cities like Medellin, whose stunning scenery includes swathes of lush jungle and a Caribbean coastline filled with pristine beaches.</p>\n<p>Colombia is also one of the most affordable countries in South America. That’s one reason it's currently enjoying a wave of popularity among young backpackers. Even in the bigger cities, budget rooms are available for less than $25 per night and a meal at an inexpensive restaurant will cost less than $4.</p>\n<h2>Jordan</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Middle East is widely regarded as a no-go zone by many people who view the entire region as dangerous. This opinion is fueled by the political instability and well-publicized conflicts that are still ongoing in countries like Syria, Iraq, and Palestine. Because of this, the Middle East in general is not considered your typical vacation destination, and there's a lot of fear around visiting.</p>\n<p>The tiny country of Jordan, however, is trying its hardest to buck the trend and has become something of an \"it\" destination in recent years. Though there are safety warnings for the areas close to the borders it shares with some of its neighboring countries, it's stable politically and generally safe to visit.</p>\n<p>The main reason that people come to Jordan is to visit the famous archaeological wonder and UNESCO World Heritage site, Petra. This ancient city is made up of buildings that were meticulously carved into the red sandstone rock face over 2,000 years ago, when it was the epicenter of a vast empire.</p>\n<p>But that's not all there is to Jordan. Modern cities like Amman and exciting adventure activities available make it a diverse location.

An inexpensive meal will cost around $7.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

After all, older adults are more likely to be sitting on a large nest egg and are often resistant to getting financial help from others for fear of losing independence. Both of those traits make them tempting targets for scammers and con artists.</p>\n<p>However, just because scammers traditionally like to hit up Nana and Poppy does not mean that young adults are shielded from the problem. In fact, according to a recently released Federal Trade Commission study, more adults aged 20–29 reported losing money to financial scams in 2017 than did any other age group. The study found that 40 percent of adults in their 20s lost money to fraud, as compared to only 18 percent of people over the age of 70 — although the median amount lost was lower among 20-somethings than among the elderly.</p>\n<p>We've done a great job of helping to alert older adults to the dangers of financial fraud. Now we need to make sure everyone else also knows what they need to do to steer clear of scams. Here is what you need to know about protecting yourself from financial fraud.</p>\n<h2>The most common types of fraud</h2>\n<p>Of the types of fraud reported to the FTC, the three most common scams were debt collection (23 percent), identity theft (14 percent), and impostor scams wherein the scammer pretends to be either a government official, a loved one in trouble, or someone else the victim knows (13 percent).</p>\n<p>Although debt collection was the issue most commonly reported to the FTC, impostor scams were the type of fraud that cost victims the most money. Consumers reportedly lost $328 million total in 2017 to this type of scam.</p>\n<p>Each of these types of fraud requires a different protection strategy, and savvy consumers should use all of these approaches to make sure they are covered in case of any type of fraud.</p>\n<h2>1. Know your debt collection rights</h2>\n<p>Getting a phone call from a debt collector can be nerve-wracking for anyone, and debt collection scams rely on your natural fear of financial consequences. The best way to avoid becoming a victim of such a scam is to know your rights as a borrower. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, any debt collector who contacts with a claim that you owe payment is required by law to tell you the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The name of the creditor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The amount you owe.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fact that you can dispute the debt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fact that you can request the name and address of the original creditor if it is different from the current creditor.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a debt collector doesn't provide this information when first contacting you, he or she is required to send you written notice that includes this information within five days of that initial contact.</p>\n<p>It is a red flag if you receive a call from a debt collector who balks at providing you with this information. In addition, while debt collectors have the right to be persistent and can tell you the potential consequences of failing to pay your debt, intimidation tactics to get you to pay what they claim you owe are also a common scheme from con artists.</p>\n<p>You also have the right to refuse to discuss any debt until you receive a written validation notice from the creditor, which must include the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor, and a description of your rights under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</p>\n<p>Asking for this notice will protect your rights with legitimate debt collectors and scare off any scam artists who are trying to make a buck off your fear. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-things-debt-collectors-dont-want-you-to-know?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Things Debt Collectors Don't Want You to Know</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>2. Freeze your credit to protect yourself from identity theft</h2>\n<p>Identity theft is the 21st Century boogeyman, and for good reason. Our information is only as secure as the company that has collected it. No product or service can wholly protect you from the possibility of someone using your identity.</p>\n<p>However, you can make it more difficult for hackers and scammers to get hold of your identity by <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-freeze-your-credit?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">freezing your credit</a>. With this process, you pay a small fee to each credit reporting bureau (which has been waived by Equifax in the wake of their recent data breach), and no one, including you, can open new credit in your name until the freeze is lifted.</p>\n<p>This is one of the most effective tools in fighting identity theft, since you take out the possibility of human error. The most common method identity thieves use to steal your information is by calling and asking you. Such a thief will pretend to be from your bank or another institution you trust and will request things like your Social Security number and birth date. Even if you fall victim to this kind of fishing scam, a credit freeze can ensure that the thief is unable to live large on your credit. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/9-signs-your-identity-was-stolen?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">9 Signs Your Identity Was Stolen</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Ask for specifics to prevent impostors from getting your money</h2>\n<p>Impostor scams come in two common varieties: impostors pretending to call from the IRS or another government or official agency, and impostors pretending to be a loved one who is in trouble. In both cases, the impostor will play on your emotions — fear of an audit, fear for a loved one — to get you to wire money to their account.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the more specific information you can ask for, the better your chance of scaring off the impostor. For instance, if you are contacted by someone claiming to be an IRS agent, you can request the caller's name, badge number, and callback number and say you will get back to him or her. Then, you can contact the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at 1-800-366-4484 to find out if your caller is an actual IRS employee who has a legitimate reason for contacting you. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-tax-scams-you-should-know-about-for-2018?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Tax Scams You Should Know About for 2018</a>)</p>\n<p>You can use this same strategy for any caller who claims to be a representative from an institution or agency you deal with. If someone calls claiming to be from your bank, ask him or her for a name and callback number, and get in touch with your bank via their main phone number to determine if the issue is legitimate.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the loved one impostor scam can be stopped in its tracks by asking the caller (or emailer) to verify certain information that only your relative would know. If you are still feeling unsure, ask for a callback number in this case, too, and contact another family member to find out if there is any possibility your cousin Emma is stuck in a hospital in London before you start wiring money.

Every single one of us can be vulnerable to their tactics. But knowing your rights, taking your credit out of circulation, and asking for specific details can help you keep your information and your money secure.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Once you understand how to use airline shopping portals, you can earn hundreds or even thousands of airline miles each year — without even getting on an airplane.</p>\n<p>While many airlines have their own shopping portals, the most popular ones include <a href=\"https://www.skymilesshopping.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Delta SkyMiles Shopping</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aadvantageeshopping.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American AAdvantage Shopping</a>, <a href=\"https://shopping.mileageplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United MileagePlus Shopping</a>, and <a href=\"https://rapidrewardsshopping.southwest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southwest Rapid Rewards Shopping</a>. Eager to learn more? Here's how shopping portals work, and how you can cash in.</p>\n<h2>How airline shopping portals work</h2>\n<p>The first thing to note about airline shopping portals is that they're entirely free to use. You don't have to pay to become a member, nor do you have to pay to create an account.</p>\n<p>You do, however, need to have an airline loyalty number to earn miles in any given program. Once again, signing up for frequent flyer accounts is free and you can complete the entire process online. Generally speaking, you only need to offer basic personal information to create a frequent flyer account, including your name, home address, phone number, and email address. From there, you'll choose a username and password.</p>\n<p>In terms of ease of use, shopping portals only require you to take one extra step before you make a purchase. If you planned to shop at Kohl's, for example, and wanted to earn Southwest Rapid Rewards points on your purchase, all you'd need to do is search for \"Kohl's\" in the portal. Then you'd find several special promotions for Kohl's, along with the number of points you'll earn on your purchase, like two points for every dollar, for instance.</p>\n<p>To earn extra miles on your purchases, all you'd need to do is click on \"shop now\" and wait until you're transferred to the Kohl's website. And any miles you earn by making a purchase will be automatically credited to your account.

All you have to do is log into any portal and \"click through\" to participating stores before you shop. If you prefer to pay for your purchases with a debit card or gift cards, that's totally up to you.</p>\n<p>With that being said, there are many reasons you<em> should </em>consider using a credit card any time you shop online. First, keep in mind that the points you earn through shopping portals are doled out on top of the rewards you earn with a credit card. Using the example above, you could earn two points per dollar shopping at Kohl's through the portal, but you could also earn more Southwest Rapid Rewards points by using a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-co-branded-airline-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">co-branded Southwest credit card</a>.</p>\n<p>Credit cards also offer many consumer protections, including guaranteed returns, purchase protection, extended warranties, and more.</p>\n<p>You can also \"mix and match\" your airline shopping portals and rewards programs, meaning you can shop through an airline portal and use any rewards credit card to pay, even if it's not affiliated with that airline. This makes it easier to use your online purchases to meet a minimum spending requirement to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-sign-up-bonuses-for-airline-miles-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earn a signup bonus</a>, but it's also helpful if you like to use different shopping portals but you only have one or two <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rewards credit cards</a>.</p>\n<h2>Most portals feature dozens of popular stores</h2>\n<p>If you shop online often, you probably have a handful of go-to stores you shop regularly. You may be surprised to learn that airline and rewards shopping portals feature many of the top retailers available, including Kohl's, Best Buy, Macy's, Walmart.com, CVS.com, and eBags.com, but there are many, many more.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Also, some shopping portals let you earn points or miles for \"services\" you book online. For example, you can earn extra points with airline portals by setting up phone service with Verizon or AT&amp;T. You could even earn extra points and miles for buying a mattress online or for ordering groceries through Peapod.com.</p>\n<h2>How to maximize rewards through airline shopping portals</h2>\n<p>There are several ways to ensure you're maximizing these airline shopping portals to the hilt.</p>\n<h3>Check shopping portals every time you shop</h3>\n<p>Make sure to click through a portal any time you make an online purchase. If you don't, you're leaving miles on the table.</p>\n<h3>Compare portals to find the best earning rate</h3>\n<p>If your regular stores are on more than one shopping portal, make sure to compare portals to find the best earning rate. Where one portal might only offer two miles per dollar spent at a specific store, another portal may offer a better deal.</p>\n<h3>Keep an eye out for special promotions</h3>\n<p>Sometimes airline portals offer special deals where you can earn even more \"bonus\" miles if you reach a spending threshold. By waiting to shop until a promotion comes along, you can maximize your spending even more.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

This universal mental accounting quirk causes us to rely on the first piece of information we hear to make decisions. For instance, let's say you're thinking about saving up for a down payment on a house when you learn that a coworker just bought a house for $375,000. Suddenly, that number becomes your anchor point, and you compare all other home prices to this number.</p>\n<p>This becomes a serious problem if the average home price in your area is wildly different from what your coworker paid. If most first-time buyers spend something closer to $200,000, you're likely to overspend because your view of normal is skewed too high. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-mental-biases-that-are-keeping-you-poor?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Mental Biases That Are Keeping You Poor</a>)</p>\n<p>However, financial anchors can do more than just warp your sense of an appropriate amount to pay. Intentionally adopting anchors can also help you to make better money decisions. Here's how.</p>\n<h2>Monthly payment decisions</h2>\n<p>There are basic rules of thumb for what percentage of your income you should spend on housing, car payments, and the like. For instance, you'll often see the claim that you should not spend more than 30 percent of your monthly income on your rent or mortgage.</p>\n<p>To make this an anchor point that can actually help you make better financial decisions, take the time to do the math and use your anchor point as a hard stop for what you are willing to spend. If you net $3,500 per month income, you could plan to spend no more than about $1,000 per month on rent. ($3,500 x 0.3 = $1,050).</p>\n<p>If you decide ahead of time that your anchor point is the absolute maximum you are willing to spend, then it's easier to say no to the options that may seem like they're only a little bit outside of your price range. After all, an apartment that rents for $1,200 per month may not seem like a big stretch above your 30 percent rule, but it adds up to an additional $2,400 per year.</p>\n<p>With an unyielding dollar amount already chosen before you begin looking at apartments, cars, or other big ticket items you plan to pay for monthly, you can help prevent temptation from encouraging you to outspend your budget.</p>\n<p>Even if the 30-percent rule is unreasonable for the area where you live, you can still use the process of creating an anchor point to help you stay within the budget that makes sense for your area.</p>\n<h2>Fun purchases</h2>\n<p>I'm an avid audiobook listener, and have been an Audible subscriber for several years. Despite being a financial expert, I regularly cannot figure out if it makes financial sense for me to purchase an audiobook outright or use one of my \"credits\" for the purchase. That's because I pay nearly $16 per month to subscribe to this service. Each month, I receive a \"free\" credit, which means I'm paying $16 for each monthly credit.</p>\n<p>So it feels like I'm wasting money if I use a credit on an audiobook that costs anything less than $16. But if I buy the inexpensive audiobook outright, then I've spent my monthly $16 fee <em>plus</em> the cost of the audiobook.</p>\n<p>Anchoring could help me to make these decisions less onerous. If I set an anchor point of $10 as the maximum amount I am willing to spend (rather than credits) on an audiobook, it'll give me a mental shortcut to help me make quicker and more economical decisions.</p>\n<p>Any fun items you like to purchase can benefit from a similar hard anchor point. If you love buying notebooks, shoes, music downloads, or the like, setting a hard limit on the maximum amount of money you can spend on any one purchase will make it easier to leave the tempting but expensive items on the shelf.</p>\n<p>Of course, even with such an anchor, you still need to make sure you know how much you're spending overall. Each purchase below your anchor can still add up to quite a large amount if you're not paying attention. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-keeping-up-with-the-joneses-can-actually-save-you-money?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Keeping Up With the Joneses Can Actually Save You Money</a>)</p>\n<h2>Your time</h2>\n<p>If you're time-strapped, hiring someone to help you with necessary but unpleasant tasks can be a huge lifesaver. However, for a lot of people, the costs of a housecleaner, dog-walker, or personal assistant can feel far too high. Many will decide that they'll just do the mopping or other tasks themselves. The problem with this plan is that it still keeps you time-strapped, and it's likely the tasks will go undone or poorly done.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Anchoring can help you to make the decision about whether it's worthwhile for you to hire help. Calculating how much your time is worth will give you a baseline that'll help you determine what you can afford from service providers.</p>\n<p>To figure out your hourly net worth, divide your annual income by 2,000. (The average American works about 2,000 hours per year.) That means if you earn $60,000 per year, your hourly income is $30.</p>\n<p>If the housecleaner you're interested in charges $115 per month for bi-weekly cleaning, you'd have to decide if their two visits to clean your home from top to bottom will save you more than 3.8 hours each month that you would otherwise spend cleaning (or annoyed at the messy state of your home). The anchor point of your hourly net worth can put the cost of a service in perspective since it gives you a concrete amount to compare.</p>\n<h2>Update your anchors regularly</h2>\n<p>Creating personal anchors to help you make better financial decisions can give you a great mental shortcut. But it's important to update your anchors every so often — once a year — to make sure you're not making important new decisions with outdated anchors.</p>\n<p>Your money choice shortcuts are only as good as the anchors you're using, and if you're making decisions based on your income from a more lucrative job, the prices in a lower cost-of-living area, or old prices that have risen because of inflation, then you're likely to overspend, frustrate yourself, or even get embarrassed when you use an outdated anchor. (Imagine my embarassment when I realized I'd been using the anchor of \"tip delivery drivers $1\" for many years after my parents taught it to me in the early '90s.)</p>\n<h2>Use your anchors wisely</h2>\n<p>Knowing the maximum that you're willing to spend on something gives you a great way to know when to say no. Having such a hard-and-fast rule allows you to make smarter decisions more quickly and with less temptation.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

There's a certain sense of finality about owning an appliance, vehicle, or piece of furniture that may make it seem like you'll never have to worry about getting another one again. But there is a finite lifespan for everything, and ignoring that is how stressful financial emergencies can surprise you. If you haven't thought about the fact that your aging refrigerator will eventually need to be replaced, you won't be financially prepared when it finally gives up the ghost.</p>\n<p>That's why it's a good idea to know the average lifespan of every big-ticket item you own, so you can plan ahead for when you will have to replace them. Here's what you need to know about when to replace your most expensive durable goods, and how you can save up for these replacements without stress.</p>\n<h2>1. Car</h2>\n<p>Even if you plan to drive your car until the wheels fall off, there will likely be a point at which you face the difficult question of whether to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/should-you-fix-up-your-car-or-get-a-new-one?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">repair or replace your vehicle</a> when it begins showing signs of age. In general, you can expect to get no more than 10 to 12 good years out of your car, and replacing it with a good quality used car can set you back as much as $15,000 to $20,000. And this is assuming your car has no major problems and you never get into an accident prior to the 10-year mark.</p>\n<p>If you have a car payment, it's a good idea to continue to pay yourself the amount of that payment each month after you have satisfied the loan, so that when you inevitably reach the end of your car's life, you'll have money for a new set of wheels.</p>\n<p>If you own your car outright, the good news is that it doesn't take much per month to save up $15,000 to $20,000 in 10 to 12 years. Set aside between $110 and $170 per month in a high-interest account, and you'll have created a new car nest egg.</p>\n<h2>2. Car tires</h2>\n<p>Of course, your car won't last 10-12 years on one set of tires, so you'll need to replace them. In general, you can expect to get five years out of a set of tires, so you'll probably have to replace your tires twice in the lifespan of your car.</p>\n<p>A new set of <a href=\"https://www.angieslist.com/articles/how-much-do-tires-cost.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tires cost an average of $525 to $725</a>, according to Angie's List. To be prepared for this expense in five years, you'd need to set aside between $8.75 and $12 per month.</p>\n<h2>3. Mattress</h2>\n<p>While the myth that your mattress doubles in weight every eight years from the accumulation of dead skin, sweat, and dust mites is touted specifically to sell mattresses, it is true that your mattress does need to be replaced after a while. Depending on the mattress manufacturer, you should expect to replace your mattress every eight to 10 years. The true indicator that you need a new mattress is the quality of your sleep. If your aging mattress feels uncomfortable and you wake up sore and poorly rested, it may be time to buy a new one.</p>\n<p>A new mattress costs between $800 and $1,000, which means you only need to set aside about $8.35 per month to be ready to buy a new mattress in 10 years.

According to ForRent.com, the average sofa-buyer spends just over <a href=\"https://www.forrent.com/blog/apt_life/spend-on-furniture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$1,000 for a new couch</a>, although you can generally expect a longer lifespan the more money you spend on your couch initially.</p>\n<p>To be ready for a new couch in seven years, you'll only need to set aside about $12 per month.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>5. Kitchen appliances</h2>\n<p>According to This Old House, the average gas range can last about 15 years before needing to be replaced, while <a href=\"https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/how-long-things-last\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">refrigerators have an average lifespan of 13 years</a>, and dishwashers and microwaves are generally ready for retirement after nine years.</p>\n<p>Costs vary pretty widely to replace each of these items, depending on the type and features of the new appliances you choose.

Basement appliances</h2>\n<p>According to Consumer Reports, you can expect to get <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/laundry-cleaning/how-to-make-your-washer-and-dryer-last/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 years out of your washer</a> and dryer before you need to replace them. Your water heater will give you about eight to 12 years of service before needing replacement. Your furnace should last about 15 to 20 years, while your central air conditioner should give about 10 to 15 years of service, according to This Old House.</p>\n<p>To replace each of these items, you can expect to spend an average of $275 to $1,000 for a new washing machine, and <a href=\"http://www.kitchens.com/product-guide/washers-dryers/washer-dryer-prices/washer-dryer-prices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$200 to $800</a> for a new dryer, according to Kitchens.com. It costs <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/plumbing/install-a-water-heater/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$800 to $1,500</a> for a new water heater, and an average of <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/heating-and-cooling/install-an-ac-unit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$5,400</a> for a new central a/c unit, according to Home Advisor.

For your dryer, you'll set aside $1.67 to $6.67 per month. To replace your water heater in 12 years, you'll need to set aside between $5.55 and $10.41 per month. You can replace an air conditioner in 10 to 15 years if you set aside $30 to $45 per month. And for your furnace, plan on setting aside $9.38 to $21.11 per month.</p>\n<h2>Creating a replacement fund</h2>\n<p>No matter where your possessions are in their life cycle, you can start preparing for their replacement today by starting a replacement savings fund. Setting aside between $208 and $322 per month will have you ready to replace each of these items in time.</p>\n<p>But even if there's no way you can set aside several hundred a month to replace items that are currently working just fine, remember that any amount of money you can set aside each month will help keep the inevitable from being an emergency. Knowing that your possessions have a finite lifespan can help you prepare for the day when they will need to be replaced.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

While debt can become isolating, it's important to remember that you're not alone, and <em>The Latte Factor</em> (available May 7), by best-selling author David Bach is the perfect companion for those struggling to make ends meet.</p>\n<p>We had the honor of chatting with author David Bach about <em>The Latte Factor, </em>and he offered some additional financial wisdom for people young and old trying to manage their money.</p>\n<p><strong>Wise Bread: </strong>David, <a href=\"http://www.thelattefactor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>THE LATTE FACTOR, Why You Don’t Have To Be Rich To Live Rich</em></a> is your 13th book. You've written nine consecutive <em>New York Times</em> best-sellers, including your most popular book, <em>The Automatic Millionaire</em>, which spent nearly a decade on the best-seller list. You have over 7 million books in print. Why this book now? Also, <em>THE LATTE FACTOR</em> is written as a parable. What made you, for the first time ever, want to write a story-based book?</p>\n<p><strong>David Bach</strong>: I've been wanting to write this book for well over a decade, ever since I went on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em> with <em>The Automatic Millionaire</em> and shared the power of the latte factor on her stage. Since then, I've wanted to put out a short book that told a story people could read in 90 minutes to learn the most important principles about money.</p>\n<p>I've always been inspired by parables and short books that are easy to read. One great example is <em>The Alchemist </em>by Paulo Coelho, which is one of the greatest books ever written. Other examples include <em>Who Moved My Cheese</em> by Spencer Johnson, who also wrote <em>The One Minute Manager</em> with Kenneth Blanchard. Those books have touched tens of millions of people all over the world. That's my goal with <em>The Latte Factor</em>.</p>\n<p>I want this book to inspire the 98 percent of people around the world who want to be smarter with their money, who want to buy their financial freedom, but because they're living paycheck to paycheck, they don't know where to start. I want this book to reach the 98 percent of people who wouldn't normally read a book about money. Even though I've sold 7 million books, I know I haven't even scratched the surface of reaching the number of people who need to be reached. I believe this book, in particular, will connect with the 100 million young people in this country who are Millennials and Generation Z. These young people want to live the American dream, but many are starting to lose hope.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, this book also applies to the Baby Boomers. But I believe a lot of Baby Boomers will buy this book for themselves and then turn around and give it to their children and grandchildren because they know it's so much easier to become financially free when you start young. The number one thing people always say to me is, \"I wish I had known how to do this when I was younger.\" I think this book will be a popular gift, especially around graduation time, and it's written in such a way that even a teenager could understand the important financial lessons that are being communicated.</p>\n<p><strong>WB: </strong><em>The Latte Factor</em> comes out on May 7. Before it's even been released, what are some things that excite you about this book and its potential?</p>\n<p><strong>DB</strong>: As a matter of fact, the greatest personal satisfaction for me with this book has already happened, and that is I got my 15-year-old son, Jack, to read it. Keep in mind, he's never read any of my other books because he's not interested in them yet. Since <em>The Latte Factor</em> is a story, he gave it a shot and ended up reading it cover to cover in two days. When he finished it, he turned to me and said two things, the first of which was, \"Dad, is this real?\" He was pointing to a chart in the book that showed how a young person could have over $1 million by the age of 65 if they started saving at age 19.</p>\n<p>I told him it was real thanks to the miracle of compound interest. His next question was, \"When do I pay taxes on it?\" I explained that with a traditional IRA account, he wouldn't have to pay taxes on the money until he took it out. His eyes lit up at that point, and he asked, \"How do I get one of these accounts? I can have way more than that because I’ll be starting at 15, not 19.\" So, at age 15, my son is asking all the right questions and he's motivated to be financially free because of this book. That's a huge victory.</p>\n<p>Another thing to know about this book is that it's not just about money, which is where the second victory comes in for me. You see, this book is also about going after your dreams and the need to take risks to reach your dreams. When I asked my son the biggest takeaway he got from reading the book, he said, 'When I got to the end of the book and read the story about your grandmother, I really thought about my life. I realized I'm going to need to take risks in life to go for my dreams.\"</p>\n<p>We recently decided to move to Florence, Italy, as a family. I gave my son the choice to come with us and he decided he would. Here's what he said about that decision after reading the book: \"I realized that not only was going to Florence the right decision, but it was <em>really</em> the right decision. If I had decided not to go with you, I think I would look back on my life later and my biggest regret would be not taking the risk to move to Florence.\"</p>\n<p>That blew me away. If my 15-year-old son can come away with those two lessons, I've achieved everything I wanted to achieve with this book. If this little book can do that for thousands, maybe even millions of other people, it's just going to be incredible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<p><strong>WB: </strong>Can you explain the latte factor for those who aren't familiar with it?</p>\n<p><strong>DB</strong>: The latte factor is a phrase that has gone all over the world and impacted millions of people. I've talked about it in all of my books and shared it everywhere from <em>Oprah</em> to NBC, CNBC, CNN, Fox, and CBS. Everywhere I've gone and in every speech I've ever done, I talked about <em>the latte factor</em>. Here's why: The latte factor wakes people up to the fact that you don't have to be rich to live rich, which is the subtitle of the book. The latte factor shows you that small amounts of money can truly change your life.</p>\n<p>When I first started teaching the latte factor, I told the story of a young woman named Kim, who worked at The Gap and didn't believe she had the money to save. I showed her that by going through her expenses and cutting out her latte, muffin, and some snacks she was eating before lunch, she could save $10 a day. If she invested that $10 instead of spending it, she could be a multimillionaire by the time she retired. That little story went viral as I shared it over and over again all over the world. It woke people up to the fact that, in all likelihood, they do have the money to start saving.</p>\n<p>Again, the key is that small amounts of money can change your life. Starting with $5 a day may not seem like a lot, but if you combine that savings with 10 percent annual interest, you'd have $948,611 40 years later. That's the power of the latte factor.</p>\n<p><strong>WB: </strong>How does the latte factor play into the story you tell in the book?</p>\n<p><strong>DB</strong>: Throughout the book, you follow the journey of Zoey Daniels as she learns all these important financial lessons. Zoey is 27 years old, she lives in Brooklyn, and has a dream job working in the Freedom Tower as an editor for a travel magazine. It's exactly what she wanted to do with her life when she moved to New York and yet, when the story picks up, Zoey is stressed out because she's not getting ahead. Even though she's gotten raises at work, she's still living paycheck to paycheck. Like so many young people, she's beginning to lose hope that she can live the American dream.</p>\n<p>One day, as she's coming out of the subway station at the Fulton Center and walking through the Oculus, she sees a message displayed on a massive LED screen:</p>\n<p><em>If you don’t know where you’re going, you might not like where you end up.</em></p>\n<p>Seeing this phrase starts her on a journey of questioning the path her life is on, which is something that many of us do. We stop and wonder where our lives are going. As she begins to share her pain with others, her boss introduces her to a mentor named Henry who works as a barista at the coffee shop Zoey stops by every morning for her latte and muffin. Henry takes Zoey by the hand and begins to teach her some principles of life that she needs to learn in order to really go after her dreams. Through these mentors and the lessons they teach — including the latte factor — Zoey begins to realize she's richer than she thinks, she's stronger than she knows, and that her dreams deserve to come true. We watch Zoey go from lacking confidence and hope for her life to putting in place a system where she begins to create financial freedom.</p>\n<p>It's an incredibly uplifting, inspirational story that also tugs on your heartstrings. We have a couple thousand people on our Latte Factor Insider Team who received preview copies of the book and the initial reviews have been off the charts. A lot of people have told us the book made them realize there's so much more they can do with their lives, but they have to go for it. Wherever you are in life, if you're living paycheck to paycheck, you're behind on your retirement plan, or you simply want to wake up the dreams that have become buried in the background of your busy life, this book will give you the direction, the hope, and the road map to focus on what matters most to you.</p>\n<p><strong>WB: </strong>David, you're also known for the phrase \"pay yourself first.\" Can you talk about what that means and share with us the way you look at that?</p>\n<p><strong>DB</strong>: The three most important words you could ever hear when it comes to personal finance are \"pay yourself first.\" That's the way ordinary people with ordinary incomes all over the world become millionaires: they <em>pay themselves first.</em></p>\n<p>Before we get into what it means to pay yourself first and where the money should go, I want to share some startling statistics. The average American is going to work over 90,000 hours in their lifetime, and unfortunately for most Americans, they're going to have nothing to show for it financially. According to the Federal Reserve, nearly half of Americans can't get their hands on $400 for emergency purposes.</p>\n<p>According to GOBanking, 66 percent of Americans can't get their hands on $1,000 in case of an emergency. Seven out of 10 working men are living paycheck to paycheck, as are eight out of 10 working women. The average American has just six days of expenses set aside. We have to do something to fix this. What we should be doing is teaching our kids about money in middle school and high school, but until then, my hope is <em>The Latte Factor</em> will provide young people with a financial education.</p>\n<p>So, what does it mean to pay yourself first? It means you have to get financially selfish and set yourself up so that you're the first person paid when you earn a paycheck. I recommend at a minimum that you save the first hour a day of your income and have it moved automatically from your paycheck into a retirement account. If your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, you can have your employer move the money into that plan for you. If you don't have either of those, you can set up an IRA account.</p>\n<p>Whichever account you choose, the key is that the money gets moved without you having to touch it. We're not talking about budgeting or discipline here. We're talking about automation. In <em>The Latte Factor</em>, Henry shows Zoey how much money she could save if she earned 10 percent annual interest. We have other charts in the book that show what the savings would be with interest rates ranging from 2 percent to 12 percent. But the number that matters the most when it comes to saving and investing is your savings rate.</p>\n<p>In other words, how much are you saving?</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>You should start by saving one hour a day of your income. That comes out to 12.5 percent of your gross revenue. If you're using a 401(k), then hopefully there;s a match. Most employers offer one and it's usually around 4 percent, so now you're looking at saving 16.5 percent of your annual income. If you're in your 20s or even your 30s, that's a fantastic place to start working toward financial freedom when you retire.</p>\n<p><strong>WB: </strong>It's well-known that you hate budgets. In the book, Zoey also hates budgeting. Can you explain why you hate budgets so much?</p>\n<p><strong>DB</strong>: I've been involved in financial services and financial education for 26 years and what I can tell you is that budgets are difficult to set up and people don't stick to them. It's a lot like a diet. People tend to start out strong, but after a while, they fall off the wagon.</p>\n<p>Budgets also lead to a lot of fights in marriage because we tend not to marry someone who's our financial equivalent. If you're a spender, you’ll fall in love with a saver. If you're a saver, you fall in love with a spender. When you have two people who view money differently trying to create a budget, it can actually pull them apart.</p>\n<p>If you want to build wealth for retirement, a college education, a dream home, or a nice family vacation, budgeting does not lead to success. The secret is automatic savings. In my other books, including <em>Smart Women Finish Rich</em>, and <em>Smart Couples Finish Rich</em>, I break savings down into three baskets: a retirement basket, a security basket, and a dream basket. That's what I recommend: move savings automatically into those three baskets.</p>\n<p><strong>WB: </strong>Let's talk about three myths of money you discuss in the book, one of which is that if you make more money, you'll be rich. Why is that a myth?</p>\n<p><strong>DB</strong>: For most of us, we're making more money today than we did 10 years ago. The question is: Are you saving more? The answer in most cases is \"no.\" As our income grows, our expenses tend to grow along with it. It's this idea that when the tide goes up, the boat goes along with it. This is what's known as \"lifestyle creep.\"</p>\n<p>Basically, when you make more money, you desire more things and you spend more money to have those things. That's the American rat race. Everything in front of us is designed to separate us from our paycheck. But what people eventually realize as they make more money is that having more things actually provides less freedom.</p>\n<p>What I teach people is that it's not about having a certain amount of money so that you can stop working. It's really about having a lifestyle of freedom and choice. But if you believe this myth that you need to make more money to start saving and investing, you'll never start saving and investing. You're only going to see your lifestyle costs increase as you earn more, which means you'll never get to a place where you feel free.</p>\n<p>The message of <em>The Latte Factor </em>is that you can live rich now. You don't have to wait 40 years to feel free and have less stress and anxiety. You can live that way today.</p>\n<p><strong>WB: </strong>What about the myth that it takes money to make money?</p>\n<p><strong>DB</strong>: The common misconception from people living paycheck to paycheck or even middle-class people is that the reason the rich get richer is that they have money. The truth is most people in the U.S. were not born with money. Sure, there are millionaires who were born with a silver spoon, but most made their money through saving and investing.</p>\n<p>Tied into that misconception is this idea that you need a lot of money to start investing. That's simply not the case anymore. Today, you can start investing your spare change. There are robo-advisors and financial service companies that will help you invest as little as $1 a day. So, no, it doesn’t take a lot of money to start investing. But if you get stuck believing that, you'll never start investing because you don't see the point. Saving a small amount of money can transform your financial life. Even if you can't save the first hour of income you earn every day, start where you can.</p>\n<p>The smallest amount, even if it's spare change, can make a huge difference.</p>\n<p><strong>WB:</strong> Let's tackle the myth that someone else will take care of you.</p>\n<p><strong>DB</strong>: I've been an advocate and crusader for women’s financial empowerment for 25 years. We've had over a million women read <em>Smart Women Finish Rich</em>. My fundamental message to women is based on what my grandmother, Rose Bach, taught me.</p>\n<p>She was a self-made millionaire who started with nothing at the age of 30. By the time I was seven years old, she was teaching me how to buy stocks. But the biggest lesson I took from her was, as a woman, you have to take charge of your family's financial future. That's what my grandmother, who was married to my grandfather, Jack, did, and thank goodness for that. She changed the entire destiny of our family. I may not be doing what I do if she hadn't made that choice and taught me everything she did.</p>\n<p>The thing that I want women to know is that you need to be involved in your family's finances. Statistics tell us that 80 percent of men die married and 80 percent of women die widowed. What that means is you can't afford to be in the dark and delegate your financial well-being to your spouse. You have to be in charge of your money.</p>\n<p><strong>WB: </strong>David, your tagline has always been live rich, finish rich. When you say \"live rich,\" what does that mean to you, and how should we be thinking about it?</p>\n<p><strong>DB</strong>: For me, living rich means that I'm in a position of freedom, that I'm able to do with my life what I want to do. Now, that doesn't mean every day is rainbows and sunshine, but it means I get to spend my life on my passion, my purpose, and my family. I get to focus my time and energy on the things I love the most. That's what it means to me.</p>\n<p>The whole idea of living rich is looking at what parts of your life aren't working and figuring out what can you do to get rid of those things as fast as possible. By doing that, you open up room to get more of what is working and what you really want. What I've seen time and again is that the fastest way to fix your life is to fix your finances.</p>\n<p>Just the other day, a woman posted in our Facebook group that she decided to start saving and investing after reading <em>The Automatic Millionaire</em>. With that one change, she was able to get herself out of a neighborhood where she didn’t feel safe and out of a job that she didn’t like. Today, she lives in her dream neighborhood and has her dream job. She changed her whole life by reading one book and deciding to live rich and <em>taking action!</em></p>\n<p>Living rich means freeing yourself. You've got one life to live and you deserve to live your dreams. By fixing your finances, you set yourself up to live the life you want.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>You can pre-order the book at </em><a href=\"https://www.thelattefactor.com/insiderteam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>TheLatteFactor.com</em></a><em>.

But when an influx of cash is the result of unused student loan money, you've got to make an informed decision on how to spend it — especially since you'll eventually have to pay it back with interest. Do right by yourself and your wallet with these tips on how create the least amount of financial liability if this windfall comes your way.</p>\n<h2>1. Set it aside for pop-up expenses</h2>\n<p>You shouldn't have many expenses as a college student, but occasionally you may have to foot the bill for something unexpected, like a car repair or co-pay for a medical appointment. Use your extra student loan money to cover these costs.</p>\n<p>\"If anything comes up during the semester, you'll have the funds to cover it,\" says personal finance expert Jeff Proctor, founder of money-saving resource DollarSprout. \"If you're able to hang on to this money year after year, you could graduate with a nice emergency fund set up before heading into the workforce. This will come in handy with moving expenses after college, and it will also free up your income for other things, like paying off debt or building your professional wardrobe.\"</p>\n<p>If you choose to stash the money away for emergencies, allocate it for that and nothing else. This isn't free money that you should be spending at the bar or on dinners with friends. As tempting as that may be, you will pay for that frivolousness many times over since interest will continue to accrue on the borrowed funds until you pay them back.</p>\n<h2>2. Pay down your credit card debt</h2>\n<p>I wish I told the credit card vultures to keep their plastic when they came calling as soon as I turned 18 so I didn't max them out within months. And without the money to pay the bills until about five years later, this was a mistake that damaged my credit well into my late 20s.</p>\n<p>If you have extra student loan money and credit card debt, choose the highest interest card and pay that bill down (this strategy is known as the Debt Avalanche method). You'll save yourself a lot of stress, nonstop phone calls from collection agencies, and rejections from financial institutions. It is not worth it, no matter how much you want those new shoes or a quick getaway. Take my word for it.

Earn alternative college credit</h2>\n<p>\"About 60 percent of college students take six years to earn their degree instead of earning it in four years,\" says Adrian Ridner, CEO and co-founder of Study.com. \"Earning affordable college credit through online courses or College Level Examination Program (CLEP) exams can help you not only stay on track to make graduating on time more realistic, but it may even give you the opportunity to graduate early, which will cut down on your educational costs even more.\"</p>\n<p>The faster you graduate college, the less you'll need in loan money, and the less you'll pay overall for your education.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Pay the loan back</h2>\n<p>While you shouldn't borrow more than you need in the first place, if you do end up with extra money after all your college expenses are paid for the year, use the surplus to pay back the loans with higher interest rates to decrease the amount of money that will be owed in the future. This also lowers your average student loan interest rate, which saves money in the long run.

Hand the money over to your parents</h2>\n<p>If you're not paying for your own college education, that extra student loan money isn't yours. So if you receive a check because there's overflow, you ought to hand it over to your parents, grandparents, or whoever's footing the bill so they can reduce their own financial liability. You're not entitled to it, and you shouldn't have it without their permission.</p>\n<h2>6. Return the money to the Department of Education</h2>\n<p>You could also return the check for federal student loans to the Department of Education, and the amount will get taken off your loan balance.</p>\n<p>\"You won't have to pay any interest, and it will be like you never borrowed the money in the first place,\" says personal finance expert Rebecca Saffer. \"You typically have between 30 and 120 days to return the money from the date it was disbursed.\" (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-unique-ways-millennials-are-dealing-with-student-loan-debt?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11 Unique Ways Millennials Are Dealing With Student Loan Debt</a>)</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Hire a friend to work for or with you and it could turn into a total nightmare. Save yourself a massive headache (and keep a friendship intact) with these reasons why someone you don't have a personal relationship with is always the best person for the job.(See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-professional-ways-to-make-friends-at-work?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8 Professional Ways to Make Friends at Work</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. You and your buddy may see eye-to-eye in friendship, but not business</h2>\n<p>You have one idea of how things should be done, but your friend has a different idea. How do you reconcile that? Sometimes you can't, and a rift in the friendship could establish itself before the project even starts. Talk your project over at length and establish expectations from the get-go to avoid this initial roadblock if you <em>really</em> want to hire a friend.</p>\n<h2>2. Loyalty and work ethic are two different things</h2>\n<p>You hired your friend because he or she is a good friend, and is always there when you need them. But while their loyalty is on point, their work ethic may be lacking. Halfway into the project, they might be missing deadlines because they think they can get away with it based on your bond.</p>\n<p>Once you get a peek into that disparity, you'll regret entering into a professional arrangement. How do you tell your friend they're not living up to your expectations? It's difficult, and it could also create resentment that'll linger for the length of the project and beyond.(See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-friend-types-that-can-hurt-your-finances?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Friend Types That Can Hurt Your Finances</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Negotiating could cause resentment</h2>\n<p>If you're hiring a friend, you might expect a \"friends and family\" discount. But going into the project with that mindset will likely offend your friend from the jump. If you're not prepared to pay your friend's standard rate for services, hire someone else, preferably the pro whose services are in your price range.</p>\n<h2>4. A friend will take your criticism much harder</h2>\n<p>It's hard to take criticism from anyone, especially a friend. Likewise, you may find yourself being more critical of your friend than you would a service provider with whom you have no relationship, because you feel more comfortable being honest with your friend. Honesty is okay — you deserve to get what you pay for — but at what cost? Not the price of a friendship.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>5. Playing favorites will upset other employees</h2>\n<p>Even if you're okay with giving your friend special treatment, this favoritism will not sit well will other employees or contractors. Why does your friend have different rules and expectations? Sure, you've known each other longer and perhaps your families spend time with each other outside of work, but that's not a fair position to take when everyone else is working just as hard or harder than your friend. You don't want a mutiny on your hands.</p>\n<h2>6. When money is involved, people show their true colors</h2>\n<p>There's a reason why people say the love of money is the root of all evil: It makes people, including friends, act in ways you wouldn't expect. If don't want to see the cash-hungry Hyde to your friend's Jekyll, keep financial transactions between people with whom you have no personal investment.

Firing a friend can destroy the relationship</h2>\n<p>If your project is going down the tubes because your friend didn't live up to your expectations, you will have to fire them, but how do you do that to a friend? You don't. You hired a friend, but you'll have to fire your ex-friend. Feelings will probably be hurt, words will be exchanged, and demands may be made. None of that bodes well for the friendship, at least not in the capacity it was before the professional relationship began.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

However, the economic tea-leaf readers — financial experts — are warning that the economic winds are changing.</p>\n<p>Even though unemployment is still low, there are other economic indicators causing financial analysts to predict lean financial seasons. First, economic growth has all but stalled. The rate of wage increase has stagnated. The Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) rates, which are used to measure and predict future interest rates, economic growth, and output, are near flatlining — and threatening inversion. This means that as the economy continues to slow down, consumer interest rates will rise and investment earnings will lose momentum, possibly even losing money.</p>\n<p>Preparing for a recession is similar to preparing for a tropical storm: There's no way to predict just how bad things will get, but burying your head in the sand and hoping for the best is a <em>horrible </em>idea. Here are a few things you can do to stormproof your finances against the coming economic slow down.</p>\n<h2>Beef up your emergency fund</h2>\n<p>The first thing you do when prepping for a storm is prepare your home for the onslaught. People in coastal areas board up windows and surround their homes with sandbags. An emergency fund does the same thing financially. It's the added installation and protection that can assist you when the economy dips. It can't stop the winds, or prevent the rain, and it may not stave off all damage, but it does provide an added layer of protection. And it provides you a fighting chance to preserve what you've worked so hard to build.</p>\n<p>The traditional emergency fund is anywhere from three to six months' worth of daily living expenses — and even larger for people with high expenses, large salaries, or a job that would be difficult to replace. During lean economic times, you want to save more than the standard recommended amount.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, the average bout of unemployment lasts roughly three to six months. However, experts believe that number is slowly creeping up and could double in a sluggish economy. It has been suggested that you plan to be unemployed at least one month per every $10,000 you earn. So if you earn $70,000 a year, you should plan for an unemployment that lasts at least seven months. This formula is a great gauge in helping you determine how much you need in your emergency fund.

This ensures that they will have something to eat during a major power outage and food shortage. Adjusting your budget by reducing expenses in preparation for a financial disaster follows the same principal. Even though during a disaster you can't eat steak and lobster, you do still eat. The same is true when money is tight.</p>\n<p>Your vacation and home improvement plans may have to wait. You may have to forgo expensive advanced educational programs and even take your kids out of private school. The key is to prioritize your expenses, see what extras you can cut, and be prepared to lower the ax when the time comes. It's also imperative that you stop living on overtime, bonuses, and side-gig money. You should divert that money into your emergency fund or other liquid savings. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-budget-overhaul-tricks-for-the-recently-unemployed?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Budget Overhaul Tricks for the Recently Unemployed</a>)</p>\n<p>You should also focus on aggressively paying down debt. If you can get rid of some of your smaller debts quickly, do it. The less people you owe, the better. And paying off debt acts as a type of de facto savings account, too. Sure, the money isn't in an account and available for you to access — but if you eliminate debt, you owe less and have more money at your disposal. You'll also save on the amount of interest you'll pay over time. Paying down debt is always a fantastic idea; however, it can be your saving grace during a recession.

You have a primary job that you do. But you also have a bunch of little ancillary functions you perform. These things translate into job opportunities, or — at the very least — bullets on your resume.</p>\n<p>Take time now while you are calm and things are going well to refresh your resume and sharpen or add to your skill set (just ensure you do it without adding debt). Most companies offer training of some sort, and many will also pay all or a portion of training you receive elsewhere. Some companies even have tuition assistance or reimbursement programs. Take advantage of those opportunities now, but be sure you read the fine print and understand the guidelines before you sign on the dotted line.

Financial experts always advise you not to pull your money out of an investment in a moment of panic. Fear should never drive your decisions.</p>\n<p>Go ahead and look at your investment portfolio now and see if there are any changes you'd like to make. Risky funds will probably lose money during a slowdown, but they also rebound quickly during economic recovery. And safer investments may not lose much, but you won't make much, either. They cancel each other out.</p>\n<p>One system or investment style isn't preferable over another. They all have pros and cons and respond to the highs and lows differently. The key is to assess yourself. Will one heavy loss give you a heart attack? If so, go with something less risky. But if you're confident you can ride the wave and stand the turbulence of a risky investment, stay put. Be sure you consult a financial fiduciary and get solid financial advice <em>before</em> you decide. Knee-jerk reactions are the quickest way to lose big when it comes to investing.

If you’re like most people, you come home with all kinds of random junk food and disparate ingredients you have no specific plans to use, all because they looked good at the time.</p>\n<p>So when you decide to throw some “lightly expired” shrimp, Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One, and an entire shelf’s worth of tortilla chips into your cart when you only needed a gallon of milk, you are falling victim to a cognitive bias known as the projection bias.</p>\n<p>This bias causes you to believe that however you are feeling in the moment is how you will still feel in the future. So when you are feeling rumbly in your tummy while cruising the grocery store, you believe you’ll still want to eat shrimp-covered nachos once you get home — even though your enthusiasm for shrimp that’s gone to the bad place will definitely wane once you’ve had a snack.</p>\n<p>Of course, the projection bias does more than just fill your grocery carts with food you’ll never eat. It can also cause you to make even bigger financial mistakes. Here’s how your inability to project your future preferences can ruin your finances.

Some of that is perfectly natural. A car buyer is likely to want to purchase a car whose amenities they can take advantage of right away. But convertible sales also spike during sunny days or warm spells during the winter. In those cases, the irrational convertible owner is projecting that she will want to ride with the top down and the wind in her hair every day, just because that’s what she wants on the unseasonably warm and beautiful day when she buys her new car.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when you are in the midst of a new enthusiasm for exercise, it might seem like a great idea to buy a treadmill or elliptical machine. You want to exercise every day right now, so of course you’ll want to continue exercising in the future. There is no possible way that your new BowFlex will collect dust and/or become an impromptu clothes-drying rack within a few weeks of purchase.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways of thwarting this expensive projection bias mistake is forcing yourself to take a cooling-off period before making any major purchases. Test driving the convertible BMW may be a blast on that random 70-degree day in late February, but will actually purchasing the car still feel as reasonable a week later when the snow is falling? Forcing yourself to wait a week (or a month) before making any large purchases can help you keep projection bias at bay.

This colleague seemed to believe that she would always enjoy good health and stable employment, and that she could just continue to work forever.</p>\n<p>This kind of thinking is a common symptom of projection bias. We all tend to assume that the way our lives are now are how they will continue to be in the future. So we don’t bother to save money for a rainy day or for retirement, because we project today’s stability into the future.</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why pessimists tend to be better savers than optimists. Pessimists expect things to go wrong, and they plan accordingly. So it’s a good idea to embrace your financial pessimism and think through all the potential ways Murphy’s law could throw a wrench in your life. You’ll be less likely to assume that your current life will remain unchanged forever — and you’ll be more likely to save money to protect yourself.

That’s because you might decide to put your nest egg into a real estate venture or annuity product when you're doing well financially. If your job feels secure and you can’t imagine needing to tap into your nest egg, it can feel foolish not to invest in something that will grow over time or provide you with guaranteed retirement income.</p>\n<p>But job loss can strike anyone at any time, and if all of your investment money is tied up in a rental property that you cannot sell or an annuity that you cannot get out of, then you'll be stuck making some pretty difficult financial decisions until you are able to find another job.</p>\n<p>While putting your money in illiquid investments can be a savvy financial move for the right investor, it’s important to think through what would happen if you were to lose your job or experience a financial downturn. When you consider making such investments, be sure you also have a Plan B for if life does not continue in the same way.

So they make absolutely sure you have a great time with whatever they are selling to help you project future good times if you buy their product.</p>\n<p>Two industries that often rely on this bias are timeshares and retirement condos. In many cases, both of these types of purchases require an upfront payment for future residence. While it’s possible that you will still want to visit Florida the first week of August every year in perpetuity, or that you will want to move into the 55+ condo community after you retire, you may also change your mind and feel stuck with an expensive choice that you may have trouble getting out of.</p>\n<p>These types of purchases should also only be made after a great deal of thought, rather than right after a fun-filled weekend visit. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/are-timeshares-ever-worth-the-investment?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Are Timeshares Ever Worth the Investment?</a>)</p>\n<h2>The future will be different</h2>\n<p>The trick to keeping projection bias from destroying your finances is remembering that the future will not be exactly like the present. So it pays to be flexible in your plans for the future, and a little pessimistic about what you can expect.</p>\n<p>Even if there are nothing but blue skies ahead and your tastes never change, you’ll still be glad you kept your finances flexible (and robust).</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

When it comes to your finances, this can certainly be true.</p>\n<p>Each day, we have the potential to lose money simply because we aren't paying attention. We pay too much for items because we don't notice how much they cost. We lose money in fees or other charges because we don't read the fine print on documents.</p>\n<p>We may think this lack of attention to detail costs us just a dollar here or there. But this carelessness can ultimately represent a great deal of money lost over time. Let's examine these ways that being detail-oriented can improve your financial situation.</p>\n<h2>You'll know a good deal when you see it</h2>\n<p>If you pay close attention to what items cost, you'll know when you see a good deal. Even if you are not shopping for a specific item, take time to look at its price. That way, when the time comes to make a purchase, you'll have a sense of whether you may be overpaying. If you are keenly aware of pricing, you may learn which retailers consistently have the best deals and which stores to avoid. Depending on who you buy from, you may be able to automate this process by setting up price alerts via email or text. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/10-stupid-shopping-mistakes-even-smart-people-make?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Shopping Mistakes Even Smart People Make</a>)</p>\n<h2>You'll notice when a cashier makes a mistake</h2>\n<p>I used to work as a cashier at an office supply store, and I was not particularly great at it. At the end of the day, I often learned that I had made mistakes when giving change to customers. Few customers ever noticed the errors, so it was their loss. When you pay cash at a store, be sure to count your change before you leave. Take care to remember which bills you used to pay. If the math doesn't make sense to you, don't be afraid to let the cashier know. In addition, be sure to review your receipt to ensure you weren't accidentally charged more than once for an item.</p>\n<h2>You'll know whether you're paying too much to invest</h2>\n<p>When we invest, we often pay attention to prices and the basic return on investment. But do we know how much money fund managers takes out as expenses? Are we cognizant of what commissions we pay each time we trade? These costs can take away several percentage points from our overall returns, potentially costing us thousands of dollars over time. To get the maximum return on your investments, it's wise to examine their overall rate of return with fees and expenses included.

Your cable company just gave you free HBO. But did you notice that it's only for three months, and then you'll be charged the full monthly fee? Is that \"free\" cellphone really free, or did they roll the cost into your monthly bill? Whenever a deal appears to be too good to be true, it usually is. Read the fine print on anything you sign and be aware that rarely is anything truly free.

I assumed that the damage would <em>not </em>be covered by insurance because I had not purchased extra flood insurance. But, in reading the fine print of my policy, I learned that there was a special provision that covered me in the event of a failed sump pump. If I had not taken the time to read the policy carefully, I may have been on the hook for thousands of dollars in renovations.</p>\n<p>Insurance policies are complicated. You may think you're covered for certain things when you aren't. You may be covered for things you aren't aware of. Always be sure to read your policy so that when bad things happen, you feel confident that you're properly insured. And be sure to update your insurance plans if your life circumstances change. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/11-unexpected-things-covered-by-homeowners-insurance?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">11 Unexpected Things Covered by Homeowners Insurance</a>)</p>\n<h2>You'll notice errors in your credit report</h2>\n<p>By law, you are permitted to get one free copy of each of your three credit reports — from TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian — every year. Even if you have no intention of borrowing something, it's good to review your credit reports when you can, because they may have incorrect information about your finances. Your credit reports may also show you've been the victim of identity theft. By conducting a detailed review of your credit reports, you can ensure that lenders have the most accurate picture of your financial situation. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-read-a-credit-report?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Read a Credit Report</a>)</p>\n<h2>You'll be billed correctly</h2>\n<p>Have you ever been to the car mechanic and received a multi-page, itemized list of the work performed? Have you ever been billed by a doctor's office and seen a list of unfamiliar charges? Sometimes, bills can show a lot of charges that you weren't expecting. It's best to review these bills and identify each charge. If you don't understand something or an item seems unfamiliar, don't pay the bill until you get an explanation. You should never pay a bill without reviewing the charges first.</p>\n<h2>You know you'll be paid correctly</h2>\n<p>If you have your paycheck direct deposited in your bank account, you may not look at your pay stub regularly. But your paycheck is worth reviewing each time, just to be sure that you're being paid the correct amount. It's also important to check if taxes, 401(k) contributions, or health savings account funds are being deducted correctly. Checking paychecks is especially important for hourly or freelance workers who may have inconsistent income. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/are-you-withholding-the-right-amount-of-taxes-from-your-paycheck?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Are You Withholding the Right Amount of Taxes From Your Paycheck?</a>)</p>\n<h2>You will pay the right amount of tax</h2>\n<p>Taxes are annoying, but they are a necessary part of living in a society. And it's crucial to be organized and detail oriented when filing them. Mistakes on your taxes could end up in you paying too little tax, resulting in penalties. Or, you could end up paying too much tax if you're careless. When claiming deductions, be sure to have proper documentation to justify them so you avoid getting in trouble with the IRS.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

But while it's definitely enjoying a moment, it's also a trend that's not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>\n<p>The attraction of taking to the open roads with minimal personal belongings is easy to understand, but not everyone knows how to achieve it. If you've got a dose of wanderlust and have your heart set on trying out the van lifestyle, here's how to buy a campervan and travel across the country.</p>\n<h2>How to decide if vanlife is for you</h2>\n<p>The first thing to do when thinking about buying a campervan is to decide whether you're truly cut out for the journey. Many of the Instagram pages and blogs dedicated to this kind of lifestyle make it look both effortless and romantic. In truth, it's not a way of life that will suit everyone. There are a lot of aspects of living in a van that you may not enjoy.</p>\n<p>The most obvious one is existing in an extremely confined space. And if you're traveling with a friend or a partner, it becomes even more difficult. Keep in mind that it's also unrealistic to believe you're going to be able to keep the van clean at all times. So if you're averse to a bit of grime, you might need to rethink it.</p>\n<p>Conversely, even though they may feel small on the inside, most campervans are significantly bigger than a car, so if you've never driven one, make sure go on a few test drives before deciding.

First of all, you need to decide whether you want to build your own van interior or if you're going to go for a ready-made one.</p>\n<h3>DIY</h3>\n<p>Building your own is part of the appeal for many people and it certainly has its benefits. It's usually cheaper to buy an old camper and convert it yourself, rather than purchase one that someone's already renovated. It also means that you can customize it to your specific needs.</p>\n<h3>Ready-made</h3>\n<p>Buying a ready-made camper van also has its merits, and even though it may cost more, you'll be able to hit the road right away. If you have don't have the manual skills to renovate or convert a van, then this may be your only option.</p>\n<p>Do some research to determine what models and makes you're a fan of, then start checking sites like Craigslist and specific campervan sales sites to get an idea of how much they cost. Once you've gotten to know the market, you can make an informed decision. As soon as you see a van that tickles your fancy and checks all of your boxes, don't be afraid to make an offer.</p>\n<p>Whatever you opt for, it's always a good idea to get a mechanic to evaluate it before you purchase, as you want your vehicle to be as reliable as possible.</p>\n<h2>Pick a route</h2>\n<p>One of the real joys of traveling in a campervan is the unparalleled freedom. However, it definitely pays to have a rough plan of where you're journey is going to take you. This way, you can avoid some of the stress over where to camp for the night, or where you can pick up groceries.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>That said, you should still allow yourself the flexibility to enjoy the freedom, whether that be spending an extra night in a beautiful camping spot you've stumbled upon, or checking out a town you're never heard of on a whim. You don't need to have every minute of each day planned, just an outline of some places you want to visit and how to get between them. And don't forget to factor weather into your decision-making.</p>\n<h2>Figure out where to sleep for cheap (or free)</h2>\n<p>Paying for campsites every night can quickly add up, with some even charging prices up to around $50. So to avoid bankrupting yourself on parking spots alone, you need to work out how to camp in your van on the cheap, or even better, for free.</p>\n<p>With a bit of research and forward planning, you can find stellar options for very little money. To start, most Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and National Forest land is free to camp on, and there are numerous free campsites all over the country. A great resource is the <a href=\"https://freecampsites.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Free Campsites website</a>, which lists free campsites across the U.S. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-find-free-campsites-in-the-us?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Find Free Campsites in the U.S.</a>)</p>\n<h2>Pack smart</h2>\n<p>Packing smart is essential to a great van experience. Without some prior planning and an idea of where everything is going to go, you'll end up with too much or too little. Not only that, but your van will be a disorganized mess, which is the last thing you want when you're living in such a tiny space.</p>\n<p>It's also important to find a place for absolutely everything you're taking. A well-designed campervan should have lots of little storage spots that help maximize the space. While the idea isn't to fill all of these spaces simply because they're there, you should definitely ensure that everything can be put away neatly when you need to.

Before you start pounding the pavement, you should know that open houses aren't an excuse to show up whenever you want and act however you want. Brush up on the rules of open-house etiquette before you hit the first showing. Here are some of the big ones.</p>\n<h2>1. Be on time</h2>\n<p>If an open house is scheduled from 1 to 4 p.m., don’t show up at 12:30 p.m. and barge right in. The sellers still may be preparing their property, and they’re entitled to that time. Arriving late isn’t acceptable, either. If the time is 1 to 4 p.m., respect it; if that doesn’t fit into your schedule, pursue other arrangements, like scheduling a private walk-through on another day.</p>\n<p>“I have had a few occasions where I spent 30 minutes turning off the lights and locking things up, only to have a person stop their car while I was out picking up the open house signs several blocks away, asking if I will go back and let them in,” says John Austin, associate broker for Realtypath South Valley in Riverton, Utah. “Of course I always do, but that adds an additional hour or so to an already long day. If you are going to be late, please call the agent's cellphone in advance to ask if they will stay late. They almost always will be glad to.”</p>\n<h2>2. Wipe your feet before walking in</h2>\n<p>It’s common courtesy to wipe your feet before entering someone’s home. If there’s inclement weather, you might even be polite enough to remove your wet shoes and leave them by the door. If this is an established rule of the homeowner — to remove shoes, that is, regardless of the weather — you either need to follow it or leave. Respect is key here. You wouldn’t want someone dragging mud, leaves, and other gunk through your nice clean house, so you should expect to extend that courtesy to others.</p>\n<h2>3. Register your name when you walk in</h2>\n<p>Signing in might seem like a way for a realtor to get your information (and it is), but it also serves a more important purpose: security.</p>\n<p>“When we hold open houses for homes that are still furnished, we demand that guests sign in or they cannot preview the house,\" explains Kevin Gunn, director of general brokerage at the real estate search engine Real Living. \"We take every precaution to make sure valuables are locked up; however, the agent cannot be everywhere in the house at one time. So, please understand that signing in protects the owner of the property. Should something happen, we need a log of who was there.”</p>\n<h2>4. Let the host realtor know if you already have an agent</h2>\n<p>If you come to an open house alone, but you already have an agent, tell the agent at the open house that you are there to view it and already have representation. That way the agent will leave you alone to view the property while he or she spends time talking to buyers who are not already represented.</p>\n<p>“In my open house events, I average 125 to 175 people through the five-hour period; that’s a lot of people to talk to and divide my time,” Austin says. “It happens at every open house: I ask people if they have an agent, they say no, and I spend five or 10 minutes talking to them before they admit they have an agent, or worse — they are an agent. If you have an agent, I want to respect that relationship.\" (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/20-questions-to-ask-during-an-open-house?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">20+ Questions to Ask During an Open House</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Mind your children</h2>\n<p>If you’re bringing your children to an open house — which, in my opinion, should be a last-resort scenario — it is your parental responsibility to keep those kids by your side at all times. If you don’t think your children will behave in someone’s home while you’re viewing it, don’t bring them. Have your partner mind them outside while you view the property alone, then switch.</p>\n<p>Vincent DePalo, part of the Andre Rouach Team at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, recalls a situation where a broker brought his kids to an open house where they all sat down and ate a free lunch and made a mess. He details another awkward incident during a well-attended open house:</p>\n<p>“I once had a family of 11 people come to an open house, including the couple that was looking, both in-laws, a sibling, and three young and energetic kids ages six to 10,” he explains. “They were running around touching and opening things, climbing on window sills, and scuff-marking the walls. I could not give much of a presentation because I was so worried that either a kid would get hurt or damage the apartment.”</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. Give other guests their space</h2>\n<p>If there are other visitors at the open house while you’re viewing the property, give them equal space. Don’t crowd into rooms. Wait your turn so everyone has a chance to see what they came to see. If there’s a couple upstairs, start downstairs or outside. If they’re taking longer than you’d like, be the bigger person and exhibit patience; everyone will get through the house eventually.</p>\n<h2>7. Don’t nose through people’s personal belongings</h2>\n<p>When you go into someone's home for an open house and you’re compelled to touch something, you really only need to ask yourself one question: Is this mine? If this answer is no — and it is — don’t touch it. Don’t go through drawers or medicine cabinets or appliances. Everything you need to see right now is in plain view for you. A more thorough inspection of the property will be provided to you if you become a serious prospective buyer.</p>\n<h2>8. Keep your design ideas to yourself</h2>\n<p>You probably have plenty of ideas on how you’ll change the home once you’re in it, and that’s very exciting — for you. Remember, this is someone’s home, and they may be leaving it reluctantly, so the open house isn’t the right time or place to detail outloud how you’re going to gut the place.</p>\n<p>“It’s fine to talk about how you might knock down a wall, but do not share your design opinions about the kitchen’s state of disrepair,” adds Jennifer Porter, owner of Seattle-based Satsuma Designs. “It kills me to see all the home-show touristers bad-mouthing other peoples’ design choices.”</p>\n<p>Depending on whether a home is staged or still includes the personal effects of the owner, you may also find personal items on display. Porter suggests that you keep walking, reserve judgment, and never discuss the room and items publicly.</p>\n<p>“It’s simply good manners,” she says. “Even if you’re ready to put in the winning offer, it’s not your house yet.”</p>\n<h2>9. Schedule a second showing for plumbing concerns</h2>\n<p>Listen, we all understand that when nature calls, nature calls — but, please, try to do your business before going to the open house. And don’t go through the house turning on faucets and flushing toilets just to see if they’re working. If you’re that interested in the plumbing situation, schedule a separate appointment with the realtor, who will be happy to give you a more comprehensive tour.

Ask permission to open closets or to take photos</h2>\n<p>Closet space is a selling point for many buyers, but before you go swinging doors open, ask. It’s just the polite thing to do. Same goes for snapping photos; it’s likely nobody will mind, but ask first.</p>\n<h2>11. Get in and out efficiently</h2>\n<p>Walk through the house, ask a few questions, and gather the materials and information you need. An open house is not an invitation to linger, loiter, and fill up on wine and snacks. Take one cookie and a drink if you’d like, and go. Better yet, plan to have a meal in the neighborhood so you can get a better idea of what it’s like, which is especially important if the house you just viewed is still among your prospects.

But it's time to get serious, people.</p>\n<p>You don't need to obsess over every detail of your money just because you are entering your fourth decade of life, but there are some key things you should have a handle on if you want to achieve financial freedom and retire on time.</p>\n<p>Let's examine these questions you should be able to answer by the time you turn 30.</p>\n<h2>1. What is your net worth?</h2>\n<p>Your net worth is the total sum of your assets minus your debts. By age 30, you should be focused on building that net worth to a healthy sum. This means boosting your income, investing well, and keeping debt to a low level.</p>\n<p>It means knowing how much you're putting into your 401(k) and other retirement accounts. It means knowing how much you owe. There's no magic number for what your net worth should be at this stage, but it should definitely be in positive territory. If you have a negative net worth, work to reduce your debt load and start saving money more aggressively. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-money-moves-to-make-if-your-net-worth-is-negative?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Money Moves to Make If Your Net Worth Is Negative</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. What are you invested in?</h2>\n<p>By age 30, you should be investing as much money you can in stocks, with the intention of watching that money grow for the next three decades or more until you retire. Starting at age 30 will give you plenty of time to build a sizable nest egg, if you invest well.</p>\n<p>At this stage, you may be throwing your money into whatever investments are offered by your employer's retirement plan. But you should take time to know precisely how your money is being invested. Are your holdings comprised of low-cost investments with a track record of growth? Are you paying high fees or commissions? And when was the last time you rebalanced your portfolio? These are the questions you should be asking yourself now, and you ought to have good answers.

How big is your emergency fund?</h2>\n<p>If you're around 30 years old, you may feel like nothing seriously bad could happen to you. But life can come at anyone, and fast. At this point in your life, you should be putting some money aside for a rainy day. An emergency fund can help you absorb an unexpected expense, such as a medical emergency, big car repair, or a busted appliance. Opinions vary on how big an emergency fund should be, but you should ideally have at least three to six months' worth of daily living expenses saved in cash to endure a big life event. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-minute-finance-start-an-emergency-fund?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5-Minute Finance: Start an Emergency Fund</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Are you on track to retire comfortably?</h2>\n<p>Retirement may be decades off, but it's still crucial to get a sense of whether you're saving enough now to ultimately retire when you want to. It's been said that by age 30, you should have half your income saved. This may seem like a steep total in an era of high housing costs and student loans, but it's achievable if you maintain good savings discipline. Calculate how much you'll have saved by age 50, then 55, then 60. If you're behind your target, it may be important to bump up your current rate of saving.

Are you properly insured?</h2>\n<p>Building your net worth isn't just about making money, but also protecting it. Insurance is perhaps the one thing you will pay for that you hope to never use. You may have health insurance, but have you taken time to review your policy and understand how much you'll end up paying out of pocket if you get sick? What about homeowners or renters insurance to protect your belongings? And what about life insurance? It's hard at age 30 to think about illness or accidents happening, but there's a fine line between living a carefree life and facing a financial disaster by being horribly unprepared.

Is your savings account the right one for you?</h2>\n<p>You've probably been putting money in a savings account since you were a teenager. But have you ever given any thought to how much interest your money is earning? Are you aware of what fees you're paying? By age 30, you should be mindful of where you're putting your money and should take time to shop around for the bank that treats you best. There are many banks out there, and you don't have to settle for the one right around the corner.

What is your credit score?</h2>\n<p>Your credit score is like your financial report card. A high number means you've been responsible with your money, and you can be rewarded with lower interest rates from lenders. By this stage of your life, you should know what your credit score is. In fact, many credit cards now tell you your score each month. Ideally, you should shoot to get your score over 800, but 700 usually means you're in decent shape. Anything lower means you may want to take time to pay down debt, take care of any outstanding late charges, and start borrowing more responsibly.

Are there errors on your credit report?</h2>\n<p>In addition to knowing your credit score, by age 30 you should be in the habit of checking your credit report every year. You're legally allowed to review the credit reports from each of the major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) once yearly, and this periodic review can be helpful in keeping your finances on track. Your credit reports may contain errors, like incorrect names and addresses, and even references to debts that aren't yours. If you find mistakes, contact the credit bureaus to get the reports fixed ASAP.

What is your debt-to-income ratio?</h2>\n<p>At this point in your life, you may be considering buying a home. When you seek to get a mortgage loan, lenders will want to know the ratio of your debts versus your income. A ratio that is above 43 percent is considered too high by some lenders, and you may find it difficult or even impossible to get a reasonable loan. If your debt-to-income ratio is nearing this level, it's time to start paying off whatever loans and credit card bills you have.

Here's How to Let Go\" rel=\"nofollow\">ShareThis</a><p>When it's time to sell your home, whether due to financial necessity or another reason, it can be hard to let go. This is especially true if you have lived in a place for a long time and have a lot of memories tied to it. Maybe you brought your first child home there or it was the first house you bought with your significant other.</p>\n<p>It's completely normal to feel sad about leaving a home that you have loved, particularly if you aren't leaving willingly. If you are selling because you need the money, because you're getting divorced, or because you have a new job in another location, this can make it even harder to let the old house go. Fortunately, there are ways to make the process easier on yourself. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-signs-youre-ready-to-sell-your-house?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Signs You're Ready to Sell Your House</a>)</p>\n<h2>Focus on what you gain</h2>\n<p>Start by remembering what you stand to gain from selling your home. If you need the money, think about the debt you can pay off by selling the house. If you're struggling to pay the mortgage, consider what your life will be like without that stress every month. Consider the freedom you'll have, the better pay or office environment waiting at your new job, or the way you'll be better able to focus on other goals and values.</p>\n<p>This may feel forced at the beginning, but make yourself list these things out. It will help to write them down where you can see them. Then, when you start to feel down about moving, look at your list and remember why you chose to sell in the first place. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-signs-youre-paying-too-much-for-your-mortgage?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Signs You're Paying Too Much for Your Mortgage</a>)</p>\n<h2>Redefine \"home\"</h2>\n<p>You may find that your real home is wherever the people you love are. This may be your spouse, your parents, your kids, or friends who are like family. When you think of home in terms of people rather than in terms of a place, it can make it easier to leave a house that you have loved.</p>\n<h2>Neutralize the home early</h2>\n<p>Most realtors suggest making your home less personal so that it will appeal to potential buyers. This means removing family portraits, framed diplomas, and anything else personalized that screams <em>you</em>. While their intent is to make it easier for potential buyers to see themselves and their own things in your home, it can also help you let go, too.</p>\n<p>Sure, it's hard to take your memories down off the wall. Once you're used to not seeing them there, though, you'll find yourself beginning to detach emotionally from the home. Slowly, you'll realize that you carry your memories within yourself — they don't require the house. If you're really struggling to let go of your home, it may be a good idea to do this earlier rather than later. That will give you more time to detach and will help you see your home as a product to be sold.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Say goodbye</h2>\n<p>Give yourself the time and space you need to say goodbye to your home in your own way. This will look different for everyone. You may want to throw one last big party at your house. On the other hand, you may want to kick everyone else out and spend time alone in each room, remembering the things that happened there and why you hold those memories so dear.</p>\n<p>Some people find that it helps to go through some sort of goodbye ritual. They may want to burn sage in every room, or say a prayer or blessing. The important thing is that you find something you feel is right in helping you make peace with saying goodbye and moving forward.</p>\n<h2>Let yourself grieve</h2>\n<p>Grief is not a process you can complete overnight. Even if you effectively say goodbye to your house, you may find yourself thinking of it and feeling sad for a long time after your move. Instead of pushing these feelings away and telling yourself that they aren't helpful, let yourself feel them. You may experience more than sadness, as grief can take make forms; anger, confusion, frustration, and more. Acknowledge these feelings, recognize that you won't feel this way forever, and give yourself proper time to get over your loss.</p>\n<p>It can be hard to leave a house you loved, but with time, your heart will heal and move on. Remember that one chapter closing means another is opening, so try to take an optimistic point of view in embracing the next adventure. You'll have a new place to call home, which means you get to make new memories there with the people you love. Eventually, you'll look back on your old home with a fondness that comes without sadness.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Luckily, doing so is fairly easy thanks to an agreement the federal government has with AnnualCreditReport.com. By signing up through this website, you can get a free <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/13-things-you-dont-know-about-your-credit-report-but-should?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">copy of your credit report</a> from all three credit reporting agencies — Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion — once a year.</p>\n<p>According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), checking your credit report is the best way to find actual errors and mistakes. They even note that you could spread your free credit reports from the three agencies throughout the year so you can check for errors every few months — for example, getting your Experian report in May, your Equifax report in August, and your TransUnion report in December.</p>\n<h2>Get errors fixed immediately</h2>\n<p>By checking the details on your credit report frequently, you could discover mistakes early and before they do much damage. If you do find a mistake and get it corrected, you could also see your credit score rise at a rapid pace.</p>\n<p>But how fast can the needle move? It really depends. Recently, I chatted with someone whose credit score surged 42 points within a month after they discovered incorrect late payments on their credit report. They took the steps outlined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0151-disputing-errors-credit-reports\" target=\"_blank\">dispute the incorrect data</a>, then watched their score bounce back once it was removed. As the FTC notes, credit reporting agencies have 30 days to investigate disputes, which is likely why this person's score bounced back so fast.</p>\n<p>Barry Paperno, a former consumer affairs manager for FICO and founder of the blog SpeakingofCredit.com, says that this scenario — where someone's score goes up within a matter of weeks — isn't that surprising.</p>\n<p>Your credit score doesn't have a memory, meaning that each time it's requested, current information is used to present your score for that day. \"So if you remove negative information, it's as it if never happened,\" Paperno said.</p>\n<p>Whatever negative information or marks against you don't exist anymore, so they don't drag your score down. Paperno also says that, in this particular case, it's no wonder her score was 42 points lower than it should have been. Since your payment history makes up the biggest chunk of your FICO score at 35 percent, this kind of false reporting can make a bigger impact than other types.</p>\n<p>\"A late payment can cause your score to plummet,\" he said, adding that it depends on how recently it occurred and other information on the credit report.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/should-you-always-dispute-mistakes-on-your-credit-report?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">disputing information on your credit report</a> is a smart move if something is off, this isn't a strategy that will work for everyone. You aren't going to get negative information removed from your report just for asking, says Paperno. If you dispute information that's actually right, you're just wasting everyone's time.</p>\n<p>But if information is incorrect, such as a falsely reported late payment or an account that isn't even yours, take the steps to dispute the information with the credit reporting agency and the creditor. Disputing false information can help your credit score in a huge way.</p>\n<p>\"Accuracy is important,\" he says. Since your credit score is a predictor of future risk, you want to make sure everything included in your credit report is correct. The good, the bad, and the ugly — it should all be in there. Once you start watching your credit report with an eagle eye, however, you will hopefully learn how to get your credit score in the \"very good\" or \"excellent\" range and keep it there.

Paperno says looking at how your FICO score is determined can clue you in to your next steps.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Pay your bills on time</h3>\n<p>First, pay your bills on time. Paperno says you should be doing this anyway, but that this step can have the greatest impact on your score. Remember that your payment history makes up 35 percent of your FICO score, and you'll understand just how important this is if you make even one late payment.</p>\n<p>\"If you can't do that, then you're not in a position to raise your score,\" said Paperno. \"Your goal is to get solvent.\"</p>\n<h3>Pay down balances</h3>\n<p>Next up, Paperno says you should pay down any credit card balances and debts you have right away. This is especially true if your credit utilization (the amounts you owe in relation to your credit limits) is over 10 percent.</p>\n<p>\"The ideal credit utilization is between one and 10 percent,\" said Paperno. \"That's going to give you the most bang for your buck.\" Why? Because your <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/this-one-ratio-is-the-key-to-a-good-credit-score?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit utilization ratio</a> makes up another 30 percent of your FICO score.</p>\n<h3>Don't open too many new credit cards</h3>\n<p>Other steps you can take to improve your credit score include refraining from opening too many new accounts, but also maintaining a good mix of different types of credit. Keeping old credit lines open — even if you're not using them — is also a good move since it can keep your utilization down and increase the average length of your credit history.

Not only do these tiny dwellings offer less maintenance and upkeep for the homeowner, but they can make your life simpler, too.</p>\n<h2>Tiny home costs</h2>\n<p><em>The Tiny Life</em> founder, Ryan Mitchell, says that, in addition to the simplicity aspect, tiny homes come with financial benefits that are hard to deny. Mitchell says that he's been in his tiny home for almost five years and pays only $15 per month in utilities. His \"all in\" cost of living is around $575 per month, including food, gas, insurance, phone, and other living expenses.</p>\n<p>Of course, part of the allure of tiny homes is the fairly low upfront cost. According to <em>The Tiny Life, </em>building a tiny home with raw materials can <a href=\"https://thetinylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/TinyHouses-Infographic-1000wlogo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">cost as little as $23,000</a>. Prebuilt or used tiny homes run the gamut from $5,000 to up to $75,000, on average, but they still cost considerably less than the national median home value of $218,000.</p>\n<h2>Financing options</h2>\n<p>The relatively low cost of tiny home living opens the door to a world of possibilities when it comes to financing, but the type of loan you'll need depends on the tiny home you buy. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/9-things-to-consider-before-retiring-to-a-tiny-home-or-rv?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">9 Things to Consider Before Retiring to a Tiny Home or RV</a>)</p>\n<h3>Mortgage</h3>\n<p>According to Fred Glick, CEO of U.S. Loans Mortgage Inc., homeowners who want to buy a small home that is permanently affixed to a foundation and sold with a lot will need to apply for a traditional mortgage for their tiny home unless they have the cash to pay for it outright. The mortgage application and closing processes would be exactly the same as if they were buying any other home in this case, with the only difference being the size of the home.</p>\n<p>One big benefit of this strategy is that, with a traditional mortgage, tiny home dwellers may be able to qualify for a lower interest rate than they could get with other financial products.</p>\n<h3>Personal loan</h3>\n<p>Personal loans are also popular when it comes to financing tiny homes. Since most personal loans are usually available in amounts up to $35,000, they are often enough to cover the cost of a tiny home altogether. And since personal loans come with fixed interest rates, fixed monthly payments, and a fixed repayment schedule, these loans can mimic a traditional fixed rate mortgage. However, interest rates are often higher on personal loans since they are unsecured.</p>\n<h3>Cash</h3>\n<p>Mitchell says that many people also choose to build in stages and save up to pay in cash as they go. This way, they pay for their tiny home over a period of time and finish the project debt-free. This is exactly what Mitchell did when he built his own tiny home for around $35,000. Once he moved in, he says he was able to recoup the amount of money he had been paying in rent in less than two years.</p>\n<h3>RV loan</h3>\n<p>Another option to consider is an RV loan, says Brian B. Simmons, CEO of Ask a Lender. Since many tiny homes are on wheels, an RV loan for recreational vehicles is an obvious choice. Simmons notes that not all lenders offer RV loans, and that even those that do may not extend a loan to a tiny home. Still, you can always ask your bank or credit union.</p>\n<h3>Tiny home loan</h3>\n<p>There are also a handful of online lenders that offer loans specifically for tiny homes, including LightStream. <a href=\"https://anythingloan.7eer.net/c/27771/620917/1463\">LightStream</a> claims to offer low interest, fixed-rate loans with no fees and repayment terms of 24 to 84 months for applicants with excellent credit.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>What about paying with a credit card?</h2>\n<p>While there are several financing methods for tiny homes, Mitchell notes that some consumers who build or buy a tiny home seek out <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-credit-cards-with-0-apr-for-purchases?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit cards that offer 0% APR</a> on purchases — at least for a limited time. With a card that offers zero interest, you may be able to pay for a tiny home to be built without any interest for 12 months or longer. If you can space your payments out and pay off your tiny home within the card's introductory offer period, you could cover the costs of a tiny home without any interest at all.</p>\n<p>Some homeowners may also opt to pay for their tiny home with a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-cash-back-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">rewards card that doles out cash-back</a> or travel rewards. The rewards these cards offer provide a big incentive to use credit as payment, but there are risks that come with using this payment method, too.</p>\n<h3>Risks of financing with a credit card</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest downsides to using a credit card to pay for a tiny home is the very obvious potential for debt. Mitchell says that the majority of people who opt to live in a tiny home don't want debt in their lives, so using a credit card might work against their goals, unless they had a very specific <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/fastest-way-to-pay-off-10000-in-credit-card-debt?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">plan to pay it off</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the average credit card interest rate is now around 17%, you'll also pay a lot of interest if you finance a tiny home with a regular credit card and pay it off over time.</p>\n<p>Another downside of using a credit card is that, due to the sticker price of tiny homes, charging one to a card could hurt your credit. Barry Paperno, the former consumer affairs manager for FICO and the blogger behind Speaking of Credit, says that how much you charge to your credit cards is important — even if you have the credit limits available to cover the cost of a tiny home or any other large purchase. Since your credit utilization makes up 30% of your FICO score, charging a large sum can skew your utilization and cause your score to plummet.</p>\n<p>This may not seem fair, but that's just how it works. Imagine you have a single credit card with a credit limit of $30,000 and you charge a tiny home with a purchase price of $27,000. Practically overnight, your credit utilization would go from 0% (provided you had no other debts) to 90%. With your utilization determining so much of your score, this is practically credit suicide.</p>\n<p>Paperno says that you should strive to keep your credit utilization between 1% and 10% if you want to keep your credit score in tiptop shape. Anything more than that can hurt your score and your chances at getting a loan with the best interest rate and terms.</p>\n<p>If you're entirely debt-free and only need to finance a tiny home, however, you may not care too much about your credit score in the short-term. Charging your tiny home to a credit card can make sense, but it's still smart to stay informed and understand the consequences.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

And far from being a homebody, I travel extensively in connection with my freelance work, and for vacations with my family. But free travel isn't some elusive and impossible-to-accomplish goal, because with the right strategy, anyone can do it. Here's how I did it.</p>\n<h2>There are 3 kinds of frugal travelers</h2>\n<p>The way I see it, there are three kinds of bargain hunting globe-trotters. First, there are those who rarely or never think about <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/a-beginners-guide-to-miles-and-points?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">points and miles</a>, and look for the best possible deals on paid reservations. While these travelers are missing out on the world of points and miles, it's certainly a simpler way to go.</p>\n<p>Next, there are those who make some attempt to earn points and miles, but not enough to cover all of their travel expenses. These travelers will typically try to use their rewards to save the most money possible on some trips, and pay for the rest.</p>\n<p>Finally, there are the rare travelers, like myself, who have enough points and miles to cover all of their travel needs. When you reach this point, you're willing to use your points and miles to cover as many travel experiences as possible, and reduce your out-of-pocket expenses to almost $0.

I didn't always earn travel rewards with my credit cards, and sometimes I didn't even use my frequent flyer number on paid airline tickets, or sign up for hotel rewards. It still makes me cringe to think about it.</p>\n<p>I read blog posts, participated in online forums, and attended meetups with fellow award travel enthusiasts. My goal was to earn as many points and miles as possible, and pay as little as I could for travel. It also helped that I write about credit cards and travel rewards for a living, so I'm always staying in the know.</p>\n<p>About five years into this journey, I became the third kind of traveler — where I was able to pay for all of my flights and hotels with my points and miles, and often my rental cars. At this point, I was no longer concerned with finding \"good deals\" in cash, as I always had a way to use points or miles instead.</p>\n<p>On a recent family trip to Europe, our expenses included mostly just food and tourist attractions, as the airfare and hotel were almost entirely covered by points and miles awards. I used my <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit card points</a> to pay for the rental car, knowing that my personal auto insurance wouldn't be effective outside the United States. There were some airline taxes and fees, but these amounted to about $53 per person.

This could mean having one card for groceries, another for gas, and a third for everything else. Sometimes, we have more cards than that! We also charge everything we can to our credit cards. So long as we don't have to pay any extra credit card processing fees (which are illegal in many states), and we avoid interest by paying our balances in full, there's little cost to this strategy.</p>\n<p>We do pay annual fees on many of our premium reward cards, but we certainly feel that's a small cost for all the free travel we earn from these cards. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/this-is-when-it-pays-to-stay-loyal-to-a-rewards-credit-card?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">This Is When It Pays to Stay Loyal to a Rewards Credit Card</a>)</p>\n<h3>Sign-up bonuses</h3>\n<p>I also earn sign sign-up bonuses when I apply for new credit cards. I used to do this frequently, but now I just sign up for the cards with the best bonuses, perhaps just two or three a year each for my wife and I. But when there are cards that offer you 75,000 or 100,000 points or miles as a sign-up bonus, it's hard to say no.</p>\n<h3>Other reward-earning activities</h3>\n<p>Finally, there's a variety of other reward-earning activities and promotions that I come across. Basically, I'm always on the hunt for additional miles. Sometimes a credit card issuer will offer a bonus for spending a certain amount within the next few months. Other times, I'll ask for bonuses for renewing a credit card.</p>\n<p>There are also online shopping portals that offer you additional points when you use them. And when friends or family members ask me to help them book travel, I'll use my credit card and have them write me a check. I've even earned hotel points for sitting through a timeshare presentation, and been given frequent flyer miles as compensation for poor airline service. I don't earn that many points or miles from any one of these activities or promotions, but together they add up.</p>\n<h2>You can do it, too</h2>\n<p>I take about 15 domestic trips a year, and maybe one big international vacation, and it's amazing that I can travel so often without paying for it. By learning all you can about this strategy, there's no reason why you can't slash, or even eliminate your own travel costs altogether.

Maybe you transferred your balance to a balance transfer card to score zero interest, and wound up racking up even more debt. Perhaps you've resorted to selling stuff to raise extra funds. Maybe you picked up a part-time job or extra hours at work to keep up with your monthly payments.</p>\n<p>Whatever you've tried, it's possible it's just not enough. Enter debt management, which is an arrangement to consider if you need outside help to manage your bills.</p>\n<h2>What's a debt management plan?</h2>\n<p>With a debt management plan, you work with a credit counseling agency who creates a realistic plan that can help you get out of debt. Typically, you deposit money each month with this agency, who in turn uses it to pay your unsecured debts on your behalf according to a payment schedule you agree upon.</p>\n<p>When you get on a debt management plan, your creditors may also agree to waive certain fees or lower your interest rate. Obviously, these concessions could help you get out of debt even faster.</p>\n<p>Still, there are details you should know and understand before you sign up for a debt management plan. These plans can be a lifesaver if you're struggling, but they're not for everyone. Here are some pros and cons you should be aware of. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-debt-management-questions-youre-too-embarrassed-to-ask?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Debt Management Questions You're Too Embarrassed to Ask</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Debt management is not a loan</h2>\n<p>While <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/beware-of-these-common-debt-consolidation-traps?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">debt consolidation</a> requires you to take out a new loan to consolidate your existing debts, debt management doesn't require a loan at all. \"Debt management is a process for paying off debt through creditor concessions like interest rate reductions and late fee forgiveness,\" says Mike Sullivan, Director of Education and a personal finance consultant with Take Charge America, a national nonprofit credit counseling and debt management agency.</p>\n<p>You're not taking out a new loan, but instead creating a long-term plan to pay off the loans you already have.</p>\n<h2>2. It can take up to five years to complete</h2>\n<p>Since debt management requires you to work with a credit counselor to create a realistic repayment plan, it can take a while to work your way through one of these plans. Sean Fox, co-president and CRO of Freedom Debt Relief, says debt management can take two to five years to complete, with the longer timelines typically reserved for those with the most debt.</p>\n<p>That may seem like a long time, but remember that debt management intends to help you repay all the money you owe. If you owe a ton on credit cards and other loans, you can't expect your problems go away overnight.</p>\n<h2>3. Debt management can save you money each month</h2>\n<p>You may be wondering how debt management can help you become debt-free when you're barely keeping up with bills as it is. Fox says it's important to remember that you'll typically make just one monthly payment with a debt management plan, and that payment should be less than the total of all your debt payments now.</p>\n<p>The lower payment is often the result of waived fees and negotiated interest rates, he says. Most of the time, your debt management plan will have you move excess funds resulting from lower monthly payments into a savings account.</p>\n<h2>4. It isn't free</h2>\n<p>While debt management is a solution that works for many debt-saddled consumers, credit counseling agencies that offer these plans do charge for their services — even if they're a nonprofit.</p>\n<p>Fox says the monthly fees collected by enrolled consumers typically fall in the $10-$15 range. However, these fees are typically offset and more than made up for via savings gleaned from reduced interest rates.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>5. Debt management should increase your credit score</h2>\n<p>One common alternative to debt management plans is something called debt settlement. With debt settlement, you work with a company (typically a for-profit) that offers to negotiate your debts down so you pay less than what you owe. One of the biggest downsides to debt settlement is the fact that debt settlement plans usually ask you to stop paying your bills, and that can cause your credit score to plummet.</p>\n<p>\"Debt settlement will always create a credit rating free fall,\" says Sullivan.</p>\n<p>With debt management, on the other hand, your credit score should actually increase as the process moves along. This is because, over time, your credit utilization will go down as you pay off debt. Not only that, but the on-time payments made by your credit counseling agency (as you make your own payments on time) will make a positive impact as well. Since your utilization is the second biggest determinant of your FICO score and your payment history is the biggest factor, debt management can help you raise your score by default.

Debt management is not for everyone</h2>\n<p>While debt management plans can be helpful for consumers who see them through, they aren't the ideal option for everyone. Fox says that debt management is suited for people who are facing a less-severe financial hardship than a typical debt settlement customer. Generally speaking, this means consumers whose credit card debts are $7,500 or less, although there are plenty of exceptions.</p>\n<p>For consumers with a lot more debt than this, you may need more than a reduced interest rate and debt management help to make any progress. Some may even want to consider bankruptcy.</p>\n<h2>7. You'll learn new money management skills</h2>\n<p>Kyle Winkfield, managing partner of wealth management firm OWRS Firm, says that debt management plans can help you learn to use credit to your advantage.</p>\n<p>Creating a management plan for how to effectively and efficiently pay off debt is \"the best case scenario for leveraging debt in your favor, building credit, and instituting financial discipline,\" he says. Once you've established a system and debt is being paid off, you also learn the valuable lesson that having less debt means having more money to save and invest. For that reason and others, \"debt management is actually a great lifetime tool when properly structured and executed,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you will take the lessons you've learned paying down debt in a debt management plan and use them to avoid debt in the future.

You can do it on your own</h2>\n<p>Finally, it's important to note that many of the tasks debt management plans perform can be done by you. For example, you may be able to get your creditors to lower their interest rates and waive fees if you call and explain your situation. Whether you're using a debt management plan or not, you could also sit down and take a look at your spending and create a budget that could allow you to spend less and throw more money toward your debts every month.</p>\n<p>If you're considering a DIY approach, Winkfield suggests starting with a comprehensive list of every creditor with updated balances and interest rates. You also need to know what your required monthly payments are. From there, you should track your monthly expenses to see if you have money available each month that can be redirected to eliminating debt.</p>\n<p>Finally, you can create a debt repayment plan that will pay off all your bills over time. Many consumers like the <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-secrets-to-mastering-the-debt-snowball?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">debt snowball method</a> where you focus on paying off your smallest debts first and make minimum payments on the rest, he says.</p>\n<p>A debt management plan can do all of tasks with you, and may be the best option if you're feeling overwhelmed and need help to start.

Fortunately, the TRIO® Credit Card from Fifth Third Bank not only awards your restaurant, gas, grocery, and drug store purchases, but it provides other valuable perks that you won’t find with other cards.</p>\n<h2>Why We Like This Card</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>10,000 bonus points after meeting spend requirements</li>\n<li>3% cash back at restaurants; 2% on gas, grocery, and drug store purchases (up to $1,500 spend per quarter in combined categories)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How This Card Works</h2>\n<p>This card awards 3% cash back rewards at restaurants and 2% cash back rewards on gas and at grocery stores and drug stores, up to a combined purchase total of $1,500 per quarter. You also earn unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases and on purchases made after you reach the quarterly cap on the other categories.</p>\n<p><strong>New Account Bonus</strong>. You can earn a bonus of 10,000 bonus points, which can be redeemed for $100, if you spend $1,000 within 90 days of opening your account.</p>\n<p>You earn your rewards as points, with each point being worth $0.01. You can redeem points for cash back, statement credit, or deposit into your Fifth Third checking or savings account. You also have options to redeem for retail and restaurant gift cards, merchandise, and travel.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Other Benefits</h2>\n<p><strong>Cell phone protection.</strong> This card includes protection for your cell phone of a maximum of $200 per claim and $400 per 12-month period. This covers your primary line as well as the first two additional lines on your monthly statement. You must charge your monthly wireless bills to your card.</p>\n<p><strong>Mastercard benefits.</strong> Additional card benefits include ID theft protection and zero liability, as well as travel benefits like Mastercard Airport Concierge, Mastercard Travel Services, and TPC Private Club Access.</p>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<p><strong>High cash back in everyday categories</strong>. This card awards one of the highest cash back rates in restaurant, gas, grocery, and drug store spending. Cards with comparable rates usually limit the bonus cash back to just a couple of these categories (such as just restaurants or just gas and groceries), if any.</p>\n<p><strong>No foreign transaction fee</strong>. Although there are many cards without foreign transaction fees, they are typically travel credit cards with higher annual fees.</p>\n<p><strong>Cell phone protection</strong>. One of the extra benefits you get with this card is cell phone protection, which can cover your line as well as two additional lines on your monthly bill. So far, there are only a couple other credit cards which offer this benefit.</p>\n<h2>Who This Card Is Best For</h2>\n<p>If you’re looking for a credit card that awards your everyday purchases, this card covers the most categories and offers some of the highest rates you’ll find. This card is also ideal for those who have balances on other cards and want to eliminate some of that debt without paying interest. Further, there are no foreign transaction fees and no annual fee, so if you need a card for making foreign purchases, you’ll save money on some of the fees that other cards charge for those purchases.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n              <div id=\"below-content\" class=\"mobile-ad\">\n                  </div>\n      \n    </div>", "body_type": "html", "lang": "en", "timestamp": "2025-10-13T05:49:20.721400"}

Perhaps you've spent significant periods of your life overseas exploring various locations, but making the move to another country is entirely different. It can be a daunting prospect, but you should do thorough research rather than making this kind of decision on a whim.</p>\n<p>There are several steps you'll need to take to get ready for your big move, but one of the most important steps is to schedule at least one reconnaissance trip to your chosen country. This will enable you to make a fully informed decision as to whether or not that location is right for you. Here's what you need to do, and the info you should gather while you're in your desired retirement location. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-countries-where-you-can-retire-for-1000-a-month?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Countries Where You Can Retire for $1,000 a Month</a>)</p>\n<h2>Meet as many people as you can</h2>\n<p>The best place to start on your reconnaissance mission is to get the lowdown from people in the know. People who live and work in your potential destination can provide you with personal accounts of the important aspects of everyday life.</p>\n<h3>Expats</h3>\n<p>Some of the most insightful people to arrange to meet prior to arriving will be expats. Ideally they'll be from the same country as you, and also retired. This way, they'll know exactly what you need to do before you leave, and once you arrive. You'll also learn the pros and cons of that particular area, which will help you make your decision.</p>\n<p>An easy way to find expats is to search on Facebook or other community sites for expat and retirement groups in that location. You can request to join these groups, and tell the members that you want to meet up while you're there. Expats tend to be a friendly bunch who are eager to meet new arrivals and help them out. It may also help if you offer to buy them a coffee or a cocktail in exchange for racking their brains. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-overseas-retirement?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Get the Most Out of Your Overseas Retirement</a>)</p>\n<h3>Locals</h3>\n<p>While it may be more difficult to set up these meetings in advance, it should be very easy to meet locals when you arrive. This will mean taking the lead and striking up conversations with people wherever you go. Locals might even provide you with alternative views to the expats you meet and mention aspects of living abroad you haven't yet considered.</p>\n<p>If you don't speak the local language, you'll be relying on meeting locals who speak English. Visit places that are likely to attract tourists, as most locals who work within this area will speak English. Bars, restaurants, cafes, and shopping centers are all good options.</p>\n<h2>Ask the right questions</h2>\n<p>Meeting the right people is only half of it, because you're also going to have to ask the right questions. What you ask will be personal to you and the destination you're scoping out, but here a few questions to get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\"What is the quality of the healthcare system like, and how does it work?\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"What's the one thing you like least about living here?\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"What do you wish you knew before making the move yourself?\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"Is it necessary to speak the language, or can you get by with some basics?\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"What do you miss most about home?\"</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spend some time writing down a list of details that you want to find out before you leave, so you don't forget while you're there.

Keep in mind there's only so much research you can do online, and it could turn out to be a costly mistake if you purchase or rent a place without seeing it in person beforehand.</p>\n<p>Narrow your search down to a few neighborhoods you're considering. Google Street View is a useful tool to help you get a visual idea of what the areas are like. It's essential to remain open-minded when you're looking for property overseas, because depending on where you are, it might be very different than what you're used to at home.</p>\n<p>Once you arrive, arrange some viewings for properties that meet your criteria so you can see exactly what you'll get for your money. Ask the realtors to explain the process for renting or buying, and write down everything you'll need to do to complete a transaction.

Between one to three months would be a solid test run for living there, but clearly not everyone will be in a position to do that. Just know that a one-week trip probably isn't going to be enough time to see everything you need to see, and the less it feels like a vacation, the more you'll understand what living there is truly like.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/a-first-timers-guide-to-using-airbnb?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Use Airbnb</a> to find a local home for your recon trip, similar to what you might expect when you move there. Staying in a hotel is fine, but it won't feel like you're living there, and probably won't give you the option to cook your own meals. A short-term rental, on the other hand, will most likely have a kitchen, and that way you'll get a better idea of the cost of groceries.

They are so well known that it can be disappointing every time you see a headline proclaiming some great idea about how to pay off your debt, only to find out it's just another description of interest free balance transfer offers.</p>\n<p>While these offers can be incredibly valuable, they're only one of the ways you can reduce your credit card interest payments, and ultimately get rid of your debt. Here are five smart strategies that go beyond <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">interest-free balance transfers</a>.</p>\n<h2>1. Make multiple payments throughout the month</h2>\n<p>Every month, each credit card account issues a statement, along with a due date and a minimum payment. In addition to always paying more than just the minimum payment, you should also consider making more than a single payment each month.</p>\n<p>Credit cards incur interest charges based on your account's average daily balance, and anything you can do to reduce the balance each day will reduce your interest charges. If you can make an additional payment before the due date, you'll lower your average daily balance. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-fastest-method-to-eliminate-credit-card-debt?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The Fastest Method to Eliminate Credit Card Debt</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Pay your balance early</h2>\n<p>Even if you can't make multiple payments throughout the month, just making your payment a week earlier will save you money. When the payment gets credited to your account, the average daily balance will be lower from that day forward. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-smart-reasons-to-pay-your-credit-card-bill-before-its-due?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Smart Reasons to Pay Your Credit Card Bill Before It's Due</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. Wait to make big purchases</h2>\n<p>You can avoid interest charges by paying your statement balance in full every month. But if you aren't sure you'll be able to do that next month, there's a little trick you can use to reduce your next statement balance. Find out when your statement closing date is, and postpone large purchases until after that date. Charges processed after the end of your statement will appear on your next statement, giving you an additional month to pay it in full. And even if you incur interest, every day you can postpone making a large purchase will reduce your average daily balance.

Keep a \"clean card\" that you pay in full each month</h2>\n<p>When you have to carry a balance, the smaller the balance, the less interest you'll incur. One strategy to reduce your balance is to put some charges on a different credit card, one that you can avoid interest charges on by paying in full each month. For example, let's say you need to spend a total of $1,000, but you charge $500 to two different cards. Pay one off in full, and you will have avoided much of the interest you would have paid if you charged the entire $1,000 to a card and only paid off half of it.

Ask for a lower interest rate</h2>\n<p>Your credit card's interest rates were set based on your creditworthiness when you applied for your account. But that could have been a long time ago, and your credit may have improved since then. If you have a strong record of making on-time payments, then it's possible that you may qualify for a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-ways-to-lower-your-credit-card-interest-rate?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">lower standard interest rate</a>. Furthermore, it never hurts to ask. Contact your card issuer and ask for a lower rate. You may even let them know that you're considering transferring your balance elsewhere. Credit card users are very profitable customers, and banks will often make special offers when they fear losing your business.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

It takes a lot of work to figure out which rewards or <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-cash-back-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">cashback credit card</a> would meet your needs in the first place, and even then, you still have to figure out how to use your rewards. If you try to juggle too many cards or loyalty programs at once, you can easily find yourself overwhelmed — or worse — letting your points go to waste.</p>\n<p>If your goal is maximizing <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit card rewards</a>, but you don't really want to put in the leg work, there are several ways to make the process much more organized. Here are six ways to automate your credit card rewards and monthly payments.</p>\n<h2>1. Use AwardWallet to track your points and miles</h2>\n<p>The AwardWallet app is an online tracking service that helps you manage your airline miles, hotel points, and flexible travel points. You can join the service for free and all you have to do is add your current award accounts to get started. From there, AwardWallet will track and monitor your rewards programs and itineraries. This includes notifying you if your points are about to expire or if your point balances have changed for any reason.</p>\n<p>The AwardWallet app claims to be tracking over 1.3 billion points and miles across over 670 loyalty programs.</p>\n<h2>2. Check out Points.com</h2>\n<p>Points.com works similarly to AwardWallet in that it promises to track your points and miles from various rewards programs for free. However, this service also lets you cash in your points and miles for gift cards for shopping or dining.</p>\n<p>Joining Points.com is free, and it can simplify your life by letting you watch all of your loyalty accounts in one place. Once you sign up, you'll have one password and login for your programs, which is much simpler than keeping track of multiple logins and having to log in and out each time you want to see an account balance.</p>\n<h2>3. Use Reward Summit to maximize your miles</h2>\n<p>Reward Summit is another tool that tracks your points and miles. But this service focuses on the front-end of your transactions instead of helping you track rewards after you've earned them.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works: Sign up for Reward Summit and connect your credit cards to your account. From there, the Reward Summit app will help you choose the right card for each purchase you make based on which one offers the most rewards. You can also use the app to search for nearby merchants who may dole out category bonuses you aren't sure how to maximize. Finally, you'll receive detailed reports that show how you're maximizing your rewards credit cards compared to other Reward Summit users.</p>\n<p>If you're someone who gets tired of figuring out which of your cards would be best for individual purchases, this app is for you. Best of all, it's free to sign up and seamless to use.</p>\n<h2>4. Set up automatic credit card payments</h2>\n<p>Maybe you're not overly worried about losing track of your points and miles, but you are worried about getting into credit card debt. In that case, it makes a lot of sense to automate your credit card payments to ensure you are never late and never wind up carrying a balance.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Fortunately, most banks will let you <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-simple-ways-to-never-make-a-late-credit-card-payment?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">set up automatic payments</a> on or before your due date. While this strategy can take some getting use to, automating your credit card payments can help you avoid debt no matter what.</p>\n<h2>5. Use rewards cards only for recurring expenses</h2>\n<p>Another strategy to consider if you're leery of overspending is using rewards cards only for recurring expenses you can automate on both ends. This means you would set certain bills to be paid automatically — like utilities, cable bills, phone bills, and insurance. On the other end of the spectrum, you would set up automatic payments with your bank so these bills would be paid automatically by their due date.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this strategy is threefold; not only are you paying bills with credit you were going to pay anyway, but you're having your bill paid automatically <em>and</em> earning rewards in the process. This strategy is easy to set and forget, and it will help you avoid overspending on regular purchases.</p>\n<h2>6. Treat your credit card like a debit card</h2>\n<p>Another way to automate your credit card purchases and payments while avoiding debt is to sign up for a service called Debitize. This service offers \"credit card perks without credit card debt,\" and actually pays your credit card bills for you straight out of your checking account.</p>\n<p>The best part about the service is that it's free. After opening an account, all you have to do is link your credit card accounts with your checking account. From there, you'll use your credit cards as usual and let Debitize make regular withdrawals to cover your charges over time.</p>\n<p>The fact this is all automated means you get to earn rewards and take advantage of credit card perks like guaranteed returns, extended warranties, trip cancellation/interruption insurance, and <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-times-travel-insurance-is-worth-it?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">travel accident insurance</a> without worrying about credit card bills. Since the amount you spend will be withdrawn from your checking account regularly, you'll feel like you're using debit.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

If you can charge your purchases and rack up rewards without carrying a balance or paying interest, you usually win. If you overspend with credit and wind up in debt, on the other hand, you lose the game — and will pay through the nose.</p>\n<p>Still, there are more facets to this game that extend far beyond the risk of debt. If you choose your rewards and travel cards wisely and use them strategically, you can earn <em>a lot</em> more <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/a-beginners-guide-to-miles-and-points?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">points and miles</a> over time. Staying loyal to a brand can also help you make the most of your efforts, but only in certain situations.</p>\n<p>This is why it's important to know when loyalty pays off. Here are some scenarios where sticking to one rewards credit card or one loyalty program can work in your favor.</p>\n<h2>When you can reach your redemption goals faster</h2>\n<p>Staying loyal to a rewards brand can pay off by helping you reach optimal redemptions faster. For example, let's say you mostly stick with flexible rewards programs that let you transfer points to your favorite airline loyalty program. If you were to focus all your spending with one brand of cards that lets you transfer miles, your collective efforts with a single card brand would let you rack up points you can transfer a lot faster than attempting the same thing with several cards from different brands.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps you're loyal to a single airline or hotel loyalty program. So, imagine you want to fly first class with a particular airline to Europe for 115,000 miles round-trip. It might be difficult to secure this redemption if you were earning miles and sign-up bonuses with several airlines within a year. However, it would be a much easier task to earn the miles for this flight if you specifically used that airline's co-branded credit card, cashed in any sign-up bonuses, and flew mostly with that airline for a while.</p>\n<h2>When you can earn free hotel stays</h2>\n<p>There are also situations in which pooling your points can help you earn better redemptions. One example is with hotel loyalty programs that let you earn a fifth night stay for free. With fifth-night-free promotions, keeping all your hotel in points with one brand makes a lot of sense since you get to book five nights for the price of four. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/15-ways-your-life-is-better-when-you-have-good-credit?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Ways My Family Scores Free Travel With Credit Cards</a>)</p>\n<p>However, this only works when you have enough points to book four consecutive nights, which may not happen if you're enrolled in several hotel programs at once.</p>\n<h2>When you can earn category bonus points</h2>\n<p>If your goal is earning a ton of points and miles, you need to make sure you're maximizing the <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">travel cards</a> you have. By and large, this means using the right card for the right purchase and making the most of category bonuses when you can (e.g. using a card that offers bonus points on dining when you eat at a restaurant).</p>\n<p>Take the guesswork out of that by downloading an app like Reward Summit. This service will take a look at your rewards cards before you make a purchase and tells you which card would be optimal based on the rewards you will earn.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>When you strategically pursue sign-up bonuses</h2>\n<p>While ongoing rewards can be lucrative, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-credit-cards-with-sign-up-bonuses-for-hotel-stays?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit card sign-up bonuses</a> are where the real value is at. Many cards let you earn bonuses worth $500 or more just for spending $3,000 or $4,000 on your card within a few months.</p>\n<p>To get the most out of these offers, expect to sign up for a new rewards card with your preferred card issuer or rewards program every year. This way, you're always working toward a minimum spending requirement and a big chunk of cashback, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-sign-up-bonuses-for-airline-miles-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">airline miles</a>, or flexible travel rewards.</p>\n<h2>When you get your spouse or partner on board</h2>\n<p>Remember that you don't have to chase sign-up bonuses or ongoing rewards alone. Your spouse or partner can earn the same rewards you are, including sign-up bonuses — and this is true even if you share the same address.</p>\n<p>When you get your spouse involved, you can easily earn double the rewards in the same amount of time. You could even do better if you're able to pool your points with a spouse for optimal redemptions.

This should include bills like groceries, gas, insurance premiums, utility bills, and dining out. The more expenses you can pay with a rewards card, the more points and miles you will rack up by default.</p>\n<h2>When you pay your balances in full</h2>\n<p>It's important to remember the ultimate credit card hack: Paying your balances in full every month. None of these tips and tricks will work in your favor if you're carrying a balance and paying credit card interest every month. With the average credit card now charging over 17% APR, that interest will wipe out your rewards and then some.

In fact, it could be even better, because you don't even have to worry about driving. On a train, all you need to do is kick back and enjoy the view.</p>\n<p>From long-haul cross-country odysseys to short trips heading to destinations seldom seen, you'll want to make sure to cross these five U.S. train trips off your bucket list.

California Zephyr</h2>\n<p>This long-distance Amtrak experience starts out at Union Station in Chicago and winds its way through the plains of Iowa and Nebraska. Lest you think the route is full of cornfields, however, the train starts ascending into the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, passing by the ski town of Winter Park and into Utah.</p>\n<p>You can enjoy the red rock canyons that make Utah famous, and on hot days, thank your lucky stars that the cars have air conditioning as you pass through Nevada and into California. From here, the train passes through the Sierra Nevada until its final stop in Emeryville, California.</p>\n<p>You can book coach seats for as low as $171 one-way on this train, however, be warned: This doesn't include any of your meals, and you'll need to sleep in your seat the entire way. If you prefer a private cabin with a bed and the smallest bathroom ever (literally — the toilet is inside the shower stall), you'll need to pay closer to $700 for the ride.</p>\n<h2>2. Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>If a short jaunt back in time is more your style, consider Colorado's Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railway (named after its tracks, which are nearly two feet narrower the tracks on most trains, so as to better handle sharp mountain curves). This train has been in continuous service between these two historical towns in southwest Colorado since 1882, when it was launched to help carry silver and gold ore from remote mines in the San Juan Mountains. It's even been in 20 different Western movies, including <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em>, and <em>How The West Was Won</em>.</p>\n<p>A round-trip journey will set you back between $89-$219 (depending on which train car you choose) and takes a total of nine hours, including a two-hour stop in Silverton, before heading back for the day to its launch point in Durango.

Alaska Coastal Classic</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Alaska is known as one of the most scenic places in the world, and one of the best ways to see all the sights is by train, since you won't need to be focused on driving safely through its narrow mountain roads. There are several train routes throughout the state, but one of the best is the Coastal Classic train. This train winds through thick, foggy forests along Turnagain Arm, where you can see the famous resident belugas and other whales if you're lucky.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>This train starts out in Anchorage each morning at 6:45 sharp and heads down to the resort and fishing port of Seward, arriving just in time for lunch at 11 a.m. The train stays here for seven hours, offering you plenty of time to check out the many sights in Seward, such as the Alaska SeaLife Center or Exit Glacier. Finally, it makes a return trip back to Anchorage, arriving just in time for bed at 10:15 p.m. The cost for all of this depends on which cabin you book and when you go, but you'll pay somewhere between $172 and $351 per adult, round-trip.

Grand Canyon Railway</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>It used to be that if you wanted to see the Grand Canyon, the way to get there was by this very train, which began operating in 1901. Sadly, once cars took over, the train fell out of favor and shut down in 1968. The train had a glorious rebirth in 1989, however, when it reopened for service. Today, it's estimated that the train helps keep 50,000 cars out of Grand Canyon National Park.</p>\n<p>A round-trip ticket on this train will set you back between $67 and $219 per person for a round-trip ticket, depending on the car you choose. The ride only takes two and 15 minutes hours each way, and the train stops at the Grand Canyon for a four-hour layover before heading back that afternoon. Along the way, you can expect to see a wide range of habitats from fragrant Pinyon and Ponderosa pine forests to open prairies.

Mount Washington Cog Railway</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Northern New Hampshire's Mount Washington is the tallest peak in the Northeastern U.S. Luckily, if you're not a mountain climber, you can actually take an authentic cog railway — a train specifically designed to climb and descend steep inclines — all the way to the top and back.</p>\n<p>This train began operating in 1869 as the world's first cog railway. Even though the train operates many environmentally-friendly biodiesel trains today, there's still a chance you could ride on one of the antique coal-powered trains. For this reason, the railway recommends wearing \"dark clothing,\" to keep you from walking in wearing whites and come out wearing grays.</p>\n<p>A round-trip ticket will set you back $72 per adult ($78 if you choose one of the coal-powered trains). You also have the option of paying $51 for a one-way ticket to the top and hiking back down (it'll take about five hours, and it's only recommended for those with the right gear and are in shape). The train trip up only takes an hour before reaching the summit where you can enjoy gorgeous, breathtaking views of up to five states at once, and even the Atlantic Ocean on a clear day.

Good credit is the key to being able to buy a home or finance a car, after all. When your credit rises to the \"very good\" or \"excellent\" level (typically a FICO score of 740+), you'll qualify for loans with the best interest rates and terms.</p>\n<p>But how do you get a credit card with poor credit? It takes time and perseverance to get approved when you haven't yet proven yourself, or if you've struggled with credit in the past, but it's also hard to prove yourself when no one will give you a chance.</p>\n<p>Still, you <em>can</em> get a credit card with bad credit if you're willing to spend time fixing your credit first. Here are the most important steps you should take along the way.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Find out how bad things really are</h2>\n<p>Your credit may be terrible, or you might just assume it is. Either way, you need to find out for sure. Gerri Detweiler, education director for Nav, a company that helps business owners build and monitor strong business credit for free, says step one is <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-minute-finance-checking-your-credit-score?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">checking your credit score</a> — but not just any credit score.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Detweiler says you should strive to check your FICO 8 score — one of the many credit score types lenders use. Typically, this is the one card issuers check before approving people for a credit card, she says.</p>\n<p>Seeing your FICO 8 score is \"not crucial, but it's helpful to see where you fall using this scoring system that card issuers actually use,\" she says. Another option is checking a free credit score offered through your bank (if applicable) or signing up for a free account with a service like <a href=\"http://creditsesame.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=23&amp;aff_id=1137\">Credit Sesame</a> or Credit Karma to see an estimate of your credit score there. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/is-it-worth-paying-for-your-credit-score?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">I Checked My Credit Score in 11 Places — Here's What I Learned</a>)</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Consider other credit factors</h2>\n<p>In addition to your credit score, Detweiler says card issuers want to make sure you don't have an open bankruptcy. \"If you have an open tax lien, that could also be a disqualifier,\" she says. In either of these cases, a credit card might not be possible until the situation is far enough in the rearview mirror.</p>\n<p>Another common <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-reasons-you-can-be-denied-for-a-credit-card-even-with-good-credit?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">reason you'll get denied</a> is the fact that issuers don't want to see more than six inquiries within the last six months, according to Detweiler. If you've been applying for a bunch of cards, wait to apply again until all your current inquiries are more than six months old.</p>\n<p>Also, many card issuers don't want to see credit utilization higher than 60 percent — and they would prefer you have at least one credit card already.</p>\n<p>\"Most issuers want to see that you already have at least $500 or $1,000 in credit limits on other credit cards, which is a Catch-22,\" says Detweiler. If you do have high credit card balances already, paying down some of your debt should help your case.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Take a close look at secured credit cards</h2>\n<p>If you have checked your credit and know you can't get approved for an unsecured credit card, you should consider getting a <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-secured-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">secured credit card</a>. What's the difference? Where unsecured credit cards extend a line of credit without collateral, secured credit cards require you to put down a cash deposit upfront.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>This may not be ideal, but secured cards do report your credit movements to the three credit reporting agencies. Ultimately, this is what you want. If you decide to go this route, make sure you're comparing secured cards to find an option with no annual fee, no ongoing fees, and other perks.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Look into credit repair options</h2>\n<p>Detweiler says you can still work on your credit in other ways whether you get a secured credit card or not. \"If you don't feel confident trying to figure out what's not accurate or complete on your credit report, then you could look into some inexpensive credit repair with an agency,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Once again, this is an area where you'll want to do your homework. Look for a credit repair company that is reputable, has good ratings, and has very low costs. Also read the fine print and ask questions so you know what you're getting into. Be aware of <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-spot-a-credit-repair-scam?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit repair scams</a>, as there are many out there.</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Get added as an authorized user</h2>\n<p>Another really good way to get a credit card with bad credit is to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-build-credit-without-using-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">get added as an authorized user</a> by someone you know well and trust who has a perfect payment history and low debt. \"Maybe it's a relative, a friend, or a spouse,\" says Detweiler.</p>\n<p>This isn't the same as getting your own card, but it can help improve your credit since the primary user's payments will be reported on your credit history as well.</p>\n<p>If the primary user is worried you'll get in trouble using the card, you can also get added as an authorized user but never use the card or hold it in your possession. The benefit still exists since the main cardholder will continue using their card and making payments.</p>\n<p>Detweiler says it may also be possible to get a co-signer for a credit card, although \"most banks don't even do this anymore.\" Co-signing for a credit card may be seen as riskier for the person who needs help with their credit since both parties are jointly responsible for the debt either one charges. On the flip side, authorized users aren't responsible for repayment of debt.</p>\n<h2>Step 6: Consider alternatives</h2>\n<p>Finally, there are a few alternatives to consider. Detweiler says that, if the major card issuers aren't willing to accept you, you could try applying for a credit card with a credit union you have an existing relationship with.</p>\n<p>Prepaid debit cards are another option, but \"this isn't an ideal substitute for a credit card,\" says Detweiler. Not only do prepaid debit cards not help you build credit, but they don't offer many perks. For example, you'll have no ability to dispute purchases, fewer consumer protections, and more exposure in the case of fraudulent use. Prepaid debit cards may also have fees for transactions and deposits, so make sure to compare options if you sign up for one.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Not only can they save you time, and help you avoid the hungry crowd with mobile ordering, but they can also save you money. Sure, fast food is known for being affordable, but fast food apps can actually help you score free food. And who doesn't love free food?</p>\n<p>Of course, the best way to save money on fast food is to avoid it altogether and cook all your meals at home, but we live in the real world of unexpected traffic and busy schedules, and sometimes you need to grab something quickly. All of these apps allow you to order ahead of time to skip the line when you pick up your food and offer rewards for discounts and freebies. Bonus!</p>\n<p>Here are our favorite 20 fast food apps and the delicious perks that come with them.</p>\n<h2>1. BJ's Brewhouse</h2>\n<p>My local BJ's always has a wait of about 30-40 minutes on weekend nights. Luckily, with the app you can put your name on the waitlist before heading to the restaurant and cut down on wait times. The app also rewards members with a free mini pizookie (a pie and cookie hybrid, usually served with ice cream) when they sign up, and orders earn members one point for every dollar spent. Once you have earned 100 points, you will receive a $10 off coupon good for 90 days.</p>\n<h2>2. Burger King</h2>\n<p>The Burger King app promises $30 worth of food coupons once you sign up, but in reality, it's BOGO free coupons and other discounted meals. You can also connect your PayPal account to the app for faster payment.</p>\n<h2>3. CafÃ© Rio</h2>\n<p>The CafÃ© Rio app rewards users $10 credit for every 100 points they earn. Usually, you will earn one point for every dollar spent, but many times the app will also reward double points. And your rewards don't expire.</p>\n<h2>4. Chick-fil-A</h2>\n<p>I love the Chick-fil-A One app because it's always rewarding me with a free food item. Sometimes it's an ice cream cone, other times it's a salad. The app will also give you rewards for using the app to pay for food directly.</p>\n<p>And if you haven't used the cow calendar yet, you are missing out. Each year in November, Chick-fil-A restaurants sell $8 calendars that come with cards that have a free food item each month. This card connects to your app, making it simple to redeem your free food item of the month. Didn't grab a calendar in time? Check out eBay. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-to-score-free-food-at-chick-fil-a?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Ways to Score Free Food at Chick-fil-A</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Chronic Taco</h2>\n<p>Chronic Taco adds 50 points to your account right when you sign up. You will also earn one point for every dollar spent at the restaurant. Just 25 points can be redeemed for an order of churro bites, 50 points for a taco, or 100 points for any menu item.</p>\n<h2>6. Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf</h2>\n<p>The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf app offers a free coffee or tea at sign-up. The app also gives app users a free birthday treat and reward points for every purchase you make (a point for every dollar spent). Redeem points toward free drinks and food items. You'll even unlock certain freebie levels (Purple, Platinum, and VIP) with regular use.</p>\n<h2>7. El Pollo Loco</h2>\n<p>Earn $10 of free food through the LOCO Rewards every time you earn 100 points by scanning the app, either at the drive-thru window or ordering through the app. You also score a free entree worth up to $7 at sign-up. Each dollar you spend at El Pollo Loco is worth one point, and soon, you will be able to load gift cards straight to the app.</p>\n<h2>8. Firehouse Subs</h2>\n<p>As soon as you sign up for the Firehouse Subs app and reward program, you will earn a free large drink, and then a free sub on your birthday. You will also earn one point for every $0.01 you spend, which can be redeemed for free subs and salads.</p>\n<h2>9. Jack in the Box</h2>\n<p>The Jack in the Box app offers special in-app offers like two free tacos with any purchase or 10 percent off your order. You can also save your favorite order for quick and easy one-tap ordering.</p>\n<h2>10. Jamba Juice</h2>\n<p>Jamba Juice gives new users $3 off your order once you activate your account. You'll also earn a free treat for your birthday, and a $3 reward for every 35 points you earn.</p>\n<h2>11. Krispy Kreme</h2>\n<p>Did someone say free doughnuts? Sign up for the Krispy Kreme app to receive a free Original Glazed doughnut upon registration and on your birthday. You can also earn free boxes of doughnuts and beverages after so many purchases, which is a nice bonus if you're in charge of snacks for your office or child's school.</p>\n<h2>12. McDonald's</h2>\n<p>Compared to other fast food chains, McDonald's offers coupons and rewards on their app that are quite decent for lovers of fast food or those who find themselves in a dinnertime pinch. The app gives you instant access to food coupons, like $2 off a Signature Crafted sandwich through mobile order and pay, or free fries with any purchase on Fridays.</p>\n<p>Additionally, McDonald's also offers McCafe rewards, which allows you to earn a free McCafe drink after purchasing five — no size limits.</p>\n<h2>13. Panera Bread</h2>\n<p>MyPanera Rewards gives members rewards for three things: for their birthdays, for spending, and just because. There have been months when the app rewarded me a free coffee or a free bagel for every day of the month — no additional purchase necessary. I also like that the app rewards a free food reward after so many visits, not based on how much money I spent.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>14. Pick Up Stix</h2>\n<p>Every dollar you spend at Pick Up Stix will earn you one \"Fortune.\" After you earn 100 Fortunes, you can redeem them for a free entree. Sign up for the app through Facebook to receive free Fortunes.</p>\n<h2>15. PizzaRev</h2>\n<p>PizzaRev fans can earn one point for every dollar spent through the app. Once you earn 100 points, you can redeem them for a free pizza or entree salad. Rev Rewards members also receive free treats on their birthday.</p>\n<h2>16. Starbucks</h2>\n<p>With the Starbucks app, you earn two stars for every $1 spent, and a free drink or food item for your birthday. You also get a free drink or food item for every 125 stars you earn. They will often offer reward promotions for buying certain beverages, as well. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-starbucks-savings-hacks-that-actually-work?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Starbucks Savings Hacks That Actually Work</a>)</p>\n<h2>17. Sonic</h2>\n<p>With the Sonic app, you instantly get a free slush reward at sign-up. And new offers are applied to your Sonic app account each month. Also, every month features a deal for a $1.99 Wacky Pack, which is a Sonic's kid's meal. Other deals are usually for half-off blasts, shakes, or floats. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/best-kids-eat-free-restaurants?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Best Kids Eat Free Restaurants</a>)</p>\n<h2>18. Subway</h2>\n<p>Eat fresh and earn tokens for every purchase you make at Subway. Earn 100 tokens, and you will be rewarded with a $2 off coupon. You will also earn bonus surprises, such as a free cookie on your birthday. This app also has surprise deals that can be redeemed through your phone.</p>\n<h2>19. Whataburger</h2>\n<p>The Whataburger app rewards you based off visits rather than the amount of money you spend. If you use the app on five separate visits, you will have your choice of a free honey butter chicken biscuit, medium French fry, taquito, cinnamon roll, or a small shake on your next visit.</p>\n<h2>20. Yogurtland</h2>\n<p>Sign up for Yogurtland’s Real Rewards program to earn an initial free three-ounces for registering and another free three-ounces on your birthday. You earn a point for every ounce purchased. Yogurtland’s reward program is tiered (Green, Raspberry, and Platinum), so once you earn 60 points, you can move from Green to Raspberry and earn three-ounces free for every 36 points earned.</p>\n<h2>How to save even more with fast food apps</h2>\n<p>Obviously these apps were created to get you to spend money on fast food in order to score free food, but here are three ways you can spend less and still get rewards.</p>\n<h3>Buy discounted gift cards</h3>\n<p>Look for discounted gift cards on eBay and other reputable gift card sites to save a small percentage on your fast food budget. Load that card to your account and earn points through the app. Warehouse clubs, like Costco, also offer discounted cards to Jamba Juice regularly.</p>\n<h3>Take advantage of gift card promos</h3>\n<p>Sometimes these restaurants will offer a deal like, \"Buy $X worth of gift cards get a meal or drink for free.\" You can buy the gift cards to get the free item in one transaction and then load the gift cards on the app in order to keep earning rewards without spending more money to do so.</p>\n<h3>Do separate transactions to use more coupons</h3>\n<p>You usually can't combine coupons in a single transaction, but luckily, several fast food places are fine with you having separate transactions in order to take advantage of more than one coupon.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

If you are named executor of the estate, the heirs have the right to expect you to turn over their inheritance in a timely manner. Part of settling an estate is dealing with the personal possessions of the deceased. Often this must be done before the house or condo can be sold, or the lease terminated, and the estate closed out. The more possessions the departed owned, the more difficult this task can be. Some triaging is in order.</p>\n<h2>Before death</h2>\n<p>If your loved one is elderly, it's a good idea to encourage and help them to dispose of clutter and organize their possessions as an ongoing project. Focus on how discarding piles of old newspapers could make their home safer, or on how those clothes from the 1940s might be appreciated by the high school theater department. A wonderful project to do with an elderly loved one is to organize old photos, because there may be people in them that you can't identify without their help. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/why-holding-onto-too-much-stuff-is-a-burden-for-your-loved-ones?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Why Holding Onto Too Much Stuff Is a Burden for Your Loved Ones</a>)</p>\n<p>While doing these projects, if it feels right, you can gently inquire about any items they might be saving for particular family members, which is especially helpful to know if the person <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/heres-what-happens-if-you-dont-leave-a-will?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hasn't created a detailed will</a>. The process may be frustrating and time consuming — after all, they may have had this stuff since before you were born, and it can be understandably hard to part with such things. But the more you can do with the cooperation of the property's owner, the easier things will be after they're gone. You run less risk of accidentally disposing of important papers or family treasures.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the decluttering process is prompted by a move. When my elderly cousin had to move into assisted living, my family and I gradually cleared out the house she had been living in for decades. While she wasn't able to help us on site, we were able to set aside possessions we thought she might want to keep, bring them to her new home, and have her make decisions. Many of the old photos and letters we found were great conversation starters during our visits, especially when her memory began to fail.</p>\n<h2>Immediately after death</h2>\n<p>If your loved one was living in their home up until the day they died, you may need to check on the home immediately after leaving the hospital, to make sure it's secure and safe. Of course, if your loved one had pets, they must be attended to and rehomed without delay.</p>\n<p>Within the first week, you'll want to clear out the kitchen to prevent problems with pests, mold, and odor. Clean out the refrigerator and get the trash out of the house. Discard or give away any nonperishable pantry items.</p>\n<p>If you have not already done so, you may also need to immediately look for items to be used in the funeral. If your loved one is not being cremated, you may need to retrieve a nice outfit for the body to be dressed in. It's common to display photos, awards, and other mementos at funeral services, as well. If you're writing the obituary, you may find useful information in the home, such as school yearbooks or scrapbooks. Any record of military service is important to gather, so that your loved one can receive the posthumous honors they are due.</p>\n<h2>After the funeral</h2>\n<p>A few years ago, my family lost an uncle who was the last of his generation. After the funeral lunch, we gathered in his home and experienced the strange feeling of being allowed to roam through his rooms uninvited. I suspect even my eldest aunts felt a bit like naughty children. We were all sad, but it was also a little bit … fun.</p>\n<p>On your first visit to start sorting through the home of the deceased, take a deep breath and look around so you can remember how the home looked when they lived there. Remember that while the task you are undertaking will be difficult and sad, it may also be exciting, because you could uncover letters and other relics from the past that may help you come to know your loved one better than you ever did when they were alive.</p>\n<p>Here are a few steps to make the task of clearing out their belongings less stressful.</p>\n<h3>1. Sort through it all</h3>\n<p>There are two ways to sort through the personal possessions in the home of the deceased. One way is to comb through everything yourself, which can be exhausting. The second way is to hire an estate sale company to sort through everything for you. Many reputable estate sale companies offer sorting and trash removal as part of their service. In fact, they advise that you throw nothing away, because you might inadvertently chuck something of value. I actually tossed an old automobile company shareholder brochure into the trash while sorting through my relative's home, only to have second thoughts and retrieve it. It ended up selling for $20.

Such an arrangement could save you a lot of work. However, keep in mind that if you don't sort through the home yourself, you may miss items of sentimental value that you didn't know were there. The sale operator may promise to set aside any family photos and documents, but they won't know as well as you know what you would want to keep.</p>\n<p>This happened to me. A few months after my cousin's estate sale was over, I was online researching her obituary. Imagine my shock when I found, online, images of her original baptismal certificate and her parents' wedding certificate, written in Slovak calligraphy. These documents had apparently been sold on eBay, but I couldn't find the original listing so I had no chance to contact the buyer or seller. The most charitable assumption I could make was that the estate sale company had inadvertently sold these items that obviously fell into the \"sentimental value\" category.</p>\n<p>If you decide to do the sorting yourself, I have a few recommendations based on experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bring a friend or family member along for help.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Drag trash and recycle bins through the home as you work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pack up boxes of papers to sort through in the comfort of your own home.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't throw away anything old before checking its value. You'd be surprised what people buy on eBay!</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Make sure that heirs get a chance at keepsakes</h3>\n<p>Beyond any specific property named in the will, you probably want to make sure that everyone who was close to the deceased gets a memento to remember them by. This is tricky territory, because many decadeslong family fueds have started over granny's handmade quilts or even Uncle Joe's second-best TV trays. Some families may leave this task to the closest surviving relative.</p>\n<p>But if there are a number of survivors of equal status, you might need a more formally mediated approach. After my great uncle passed, my family used an interesting method of distributing property of both sentimental and practical value: a family auction. All the heirs walked through the house and bid on the items there, with the moderation of an auctioneer. Every dollar they paid went into a pot, later divided equally among them. You can do such a private auction before an estate sale, or in place of one. Another system is to run an auction with points instead of cash, with each relative starting with the same number of points.</p>\n<h3>3. Sell what can be sold</h3>\n<p>If you decide to hire an estate sale company, interview and research the candidates carefully. The online review website Angie's List reports that Auction Services listings, which include listings for estate sales companies, make up one of its most complained-about categories. Thirty percent of those reviews score a D or F from customers.</p>\n<p>Before a sale, you should remove anything from the house that the family intends to keep. Make it clear to the auction company what you're keeping, because they will base their prices on the amount they estimate they can make from the sale. If a sentimental item is too large for you to remove before the sale, make sure the sale company clearly marks it as not for sale.</p>\n<p>Assuming you do want an estate sale, it's not a given you'll find an estate sale company that will agree to work with you. If the house has a lot of stuff but no high-value items, many estate sale companies will refuse to take on the job because they typically earn their money by keeping a percentage of the sale's proceeds.</p>\n<p>In that case, you may be forced to run the estate sale yourself, list items in the local paper, or find a low-end operator to take the job on the cheap. Make sure to check the local regulations before advertising a garage sale.</p>\n<h3>4. Dispose of what can't be sold</h3>\n<p>Once you're down to items that no one in the family wants that also aren't worth enough to sell, your next step is to donate what you can to charity. Typical items in this category are: used clothing that doesn't qualify as vintage, worn furniture, and everyday dishes. The most expeditious way to get this stuff out of the house is to request and schedule a pickup with a local charity. Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Habitat for Humanity are three that commonly make pickups; your area may have these or others. If you don't find a charity that will pick up your items, you could pay movers to deliver the stuff to the nearest resale shop, or deliver it yourself.</p>\n<p>Try to avoid dumping stuff on the curb — some cities will fine you for this. If you can't get a charity to take the items, you could list them on Freecycle or advertise them on Craigslist as available for free. Also, some newspapers don't charge to print ads for free items.</p>\n<h3>5. Pay for junk removal if you must</h3>\n<p>If you're able to do the work of getting the junk out of the house, check with your local government offices to see if you can get a large trash receptacle parked at the curb or schedule a large item pickup for free or at a low cost. You can also check with your local home improvement store; some now sell large heavy duty bags or bins that you can fill with thousands of pounds of junk and call them to pick up. The bag option usually costs only about $150-$200, compared to about $300-$850 to rent a trailer-sized trash receptacle for a week and have it hauled away full. Cost really depends on your area and the amount of stuff you're tossing.</p>\n<p>The more expensive option is to pay a full-service junk removal company that will come into the home and remove everything you ask them to. These companies may charge $500 per truckload. On the upside, the work for you is minimal.</p>\n<p>Once you have removed, given away, sold, donated, or thrown away every last item in your loved one's home, you're ready to bring in a housecleaner for a thorough cleaning, and list the home for sale.</p>\n<p>This is a good time to devote some attention to the mementos that you decided to keep in your own home. Display knickknacks in a case, hang a framed photo on the wall, or get that ring resized so that you can see these precious things and be reminded of your departed loved one often.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Research shows that a whopping <a href=\"https://www.allianzlife.com/-/media/files/allianz/pdfs/newsroom/2018-allianz-generations-ahead-fact-sheet-3.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=1EEE6760599516273AC49A4712924887E665A52A\" target=\"_blank\">57 percent of millennials</a> spent money they hadn't planned to spend because of what they saw on social media. Here are some of the sneaky ways social media gets you to spend more, and what you can do to avoid it.</p>\n<h2>1. Impulse buys</h2>\n<p>Social media makes it easy for you to hand over your hard-earned (digital) cash with frictionless in-app purchases, like unlocking game levels, adding monthly subscriptions, and shopping for items recommended by people you follow. Within seconds, you can tap or swipe your way into an expensive, unplanned purchase.</p>\n<p>Avoid this impulse by making it your policy to save the photo of the item or subscription and revisit it at a later date. Chances are, by the time you look at the saved photo later, you won't want the item as badly, or at all. Another strategy that works for me is looking up the reviews of the item before buying. A lot of the time, items that are super trendy on social media get terrible reviews in real life. Find a mental trick that works for you, like telling yourself you'll wait until the item is on sale, to delay purchasing until you've thought it through.

Suggested posts</h2>\n<p>Social media algorithms may not be helping you in your quest to save money. If you've shown interest in anything from fashion, to coffee, to beauty products, the algorithm on platforms like Instagram remembers what it thinks you like and shows you similar content and products. When you open up the app, the algorithm may then show you a barrage of things you should buy — and they're usually tailored to your preferences, making it doubly hard to resist.</p>\n<p>To avoid this influx of temptation, be sure to avoid the Explore page on Instagram or skip over suggested posts if you can. You might not be able to avoid all temptation, but you'll definitely cut down on the sheer number of tempting photos you see. Also, avoid \"liking\" photos full of products, so the algorithm doesn't push similar content into your feed.

Those sneaky influencers</h2>\n<p>If you follow any influencers, your best bet is to unfollow them if you want to keep your hard-earned cash. Seeing someone else's perfectly-curated and styled life is a surefire way to feel unsatisfied with what you currently have, especially if the influencer has (as most do) cultivated an approachable persona.</p>\n<p>Remember, influencers are <em>not</em> just like us. That entire line of Tom Ford lipsticks, the stylish new watches, and the new clothing line at Nordstrom were probably all provided for free, as was the trip on a private yacht to a beautiful island getaway to show off all their new wares in front of epic scenery. If you start trying to keep up with your favorite influencer's lifestyle, you'll quickly end up in the poorhouse.</p>\n<h2>4. FOMO</h2>\n<p>It's telling that fear of missing out, aka FOMO, has become common parlance on social media. Most of us, to some extent, want to keep up with everyone else. And we fear being left behind, or being seen as not up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Remember that trends come and go fast, especially on social media. Once you buy that latest gear, watch, or stylish outfit, in a few months, the next trend cycle will be pushing another product. Instead of buying something to fit in with the crowd, think about whether it truly fits in with your needs and lifestyle.

An expanded social circle</h2>\n<p>Before the advent of social media, it was hard enough to resist comparing ourselves to our friends, but it's even more difficult now with our drastically expanded circles on social media. The increased frequency of social contact online has also made it harder to resist spending. Whereas before social media, you might've seen that uber-rich high school classmate once a year, now you see what she's doing everyday on Instagram. In fact, 88 percent of millennials believe that social media makes them compare themselves more with others.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Consider unfollowing people you barely know on social media, especially if they're a bad influence on your shopping habits. Instead, interact with closer friends more frequently — social media algorithms usually show you posts from accounts you interact with more frequently — rather than acquaintances you barely know, and will probably never see again in real life.

Endless MLMs from old friends</h2>\n<p>Not long ago, it seemed like every time I opened Facebook, another friend was hawking leggings, skin care, or essential oils from a multilevel marketing (MLM) company. Wanting to support friends who are trying to make ends meet is an admirable goal, but doing so can quickly add up, especially with the high prices of most of these MLM products. Before long, buying a few products I didn't need had completely wiped out my \"fun\" money for the month.</p>\n<p>Facebook allows you to stay friends with a person, but to stop allowing their posts to show up on your feed. All you need to do is unfollow. Eventually, I had to block the feeds of more than one person to prevent my feed from turning into one huge ad. Those friends can still send messages to me, but I don't see what they post unless I consciously go and check out their page. And now, when people approach me about MLM products, I tell them that I already have a supplier.

Hyper-targeted ads</h2>\n<p>Sometimes it seems as if the internet is reading your mind. Advertisers on social media are able to target you based on the data you generate by using the platform. Everything including the movie you streamed recently, the ramen shop you checked in at, and your political leanings are accessible in this new marketplace, making it harder to ignore ads that seem custom-made for you.</p>\n<p>In the interest of preserving your hard-earned cash, take steps to prevent ads from being quite as eerily targeted toward your likes. Clicking on the small triangular \"AdChoices\" logo on any online ads served to you will take you to a page run by an organization called the Digital Advertising Alliance. Once you get to the AdChoices page, you can opt out of having ad networks target you with personalized information. It won't block ads entirely, but it will help you avoid the onslaught of personalized ads.</p>\n<h2>8. Go off the grid</h2>\n<p>It may seem old-fashioned, but it's nice to take a break from social media sometimes if you feel you're too caught up in the constant marketing ploys. Research shows that spending a lot of time on social media can have negative effects on your mental health. Try consciously unplugging over the weekend and spending that time with friends in-person, or limiting yourself to an hour a day of social media time throughout the week.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Card skimmers can be installed at ATMs, restaurants, gas payment terminals, and even store check-out lines. The phony equipment is small and can be hard to spot. Some card skimmers even include a phony keypad that fits over the real one to steal your PIN.</p>\n<p>Your debit card account number can be stolen if you swipe your card in a skimmer. Unlike credit card transactions, debit cards may not offer much protection against fraudulent purchases. Your checking account could be emptied, and you might not be able to reverse the charges.</p>\n<p>Your best defense against debit card skimmers is vigilance and awareness. Here are a few ways to protect yourself.</p>\n<h2>1. Spot a skimmer before you swipe</h2>\n<p>When using a card terminal, look it over before you swipe. It can be difficult to spot a well-hidden skimmer, but some clues can help.</p>\n<p>If the terminal you are about to use does not match the other ones at the location, you might be looking at a skimmer. Number pads that look mismatched or are an odd size are a red flag. Press on the card receiver and wiggle the keypad; skimmers are designed to be retrieved quickly by thieves and may have loose parts. A keypad that is sitting on top of the machine rather than flush with the surface of it can also be a sign of a skimmer. If you're at a gas station, look at the card scanner at the pump you're about to use; ensure that the security tape is still intact over the panel before you insert your card.</p>\n<p>When you're choosing a payment terminal or ATM, go for one that is close to store employees, a security camera, or is in an open and well-lit area. These are less likely to have been tampered with by thieves that do not want to be noticed. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-tips-to-save-you-from-an-atm-skimmer?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Tips to Save You from an ATM Skimmer</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Dip, don’t swipe</h2>\n<p>If you have the option to insert your card into the payment terminal rather than swipe, do that. Chip cards, otherwise known as EMV cards, are much more secure since they do not pass your actual account numbers to the retailer. Even if someone steals the numbers from an EMV transaction, it is not useful to thieves since a unique number is generated for each transaction.</p>\n<p>Some stores have not yet adopted chip readers and will still ask you to swipe your card through a magnetic card reader. If you swipe your debit card instead of dipping it, you risk your account information to skimmers. Some thieves have taken to \"shimming\" rather than skimming; tampering with chip reader machines by installing a paper shim to block the chip reader, forcing people to swipe their cards instead. If in doubt, pay with cash. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-ways-chip-credit-cards-make-life-easier?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Ways Chip Credit Cards Make Life Easier</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. Don’t let your debit card out of your sight</h2>\n<p>At restaurants, the normal payment procedure is to give your debit or credit card to the waitstaff who takes it away to swipe it. If you hand your debit card to someone else to process, they can run your card through a second card reader and steal your information. Or, someone could simply write down your account number and the security code from your card and use it for fraudulent transactions. The best security practice is to never let your debit card out of your sight and pay for your restaurant meals with cash.</p>\n<h2>4. Monitor bank statements</h2>\n<p>You can monitor your bank statements regularly to spot suspicious activity early in case a criminal does get your account information by skimming your debit card. If you do find fraudulent transactions, work with your bank to close your account right away and minimize your losses. Your bank may offer automatic account alerts to make monitoring your account easier.</p>\n<h2>5. Withdraw cash at the bank, not the ATM</h2>\n<p>I prefer to withdraw cash at the bank a couple of times a month instead of stopping by an ATM every time I need cash. I show my driver’s license at the bank to make a withdrawal — no debit card is required. Not only does getting cash at the bank eliminate the risk of debit card skimming, but you avoid any ATM fees as well.</p>\n<h2>6. Pay with a credit card instead of debit card</h2>\n<p>Of course, the best way to protect your debit card from skimmers is not to use your debit card. It is safer to use a credit card for transactions since credit cards offer protection from fraudulent purchases. If you don’t want to pay interest to use a credit card, simply pay off the credit card balance every month. Using a credit card provides a barrier between your checking account and thieves who could skim your account information from your debit card. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-reasons-credit-is-safer-than-debit?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Reasons Credit Is Safer Than Debit</a>)</p>\n<p>Another option is to pay with cash to avoid the risk of skimming altogether. I use an <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-envelope-system?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">envelope budgeting system</a> and pay for all food expenses with cash. This greatly reduces the number of card transactions I make each month, and therefore reduces my risk of having account information stolen by a skimmer.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

These essentials will make traveling without your precious babe a whole lot easier. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-life-skills-for-working-moms?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Life Skills for Working Moms</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Milk delivery and/or storage system</h2>\n<p>If you don't want to worry about keeping your pumped milk fresh, try a milk delivery service like Milk Stork. Starting at $139, Milk Stork ships a 34 oz. cooler to your hotel and comes with a pre-labeled and postpaid package to allow your fresh milk to get back home quickly without spoiling.</p>\n<p>If you're traveling for work, your employer might be willing to pay for this service. If not, you might be able to write it off on your taxes, since it is considered a work-travel expense.</p>\n<p>If you don't use a milk shipping service, you will need to stay in a hotel room that has a fridge or freezer. The hotel might allow you to store your cooler of milk in their main freezer, but it's best to call ahead of time to see what they have available to accommodate new moms.</p>\n<h2>2. Cooler and ice packs</h2>\n<p>If you decide to store and transport your milk yourself, take an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2He5Clw\" target=\"_blank\">airtight cooler</a> and plenty of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2HbYrdz\" target=\"_blank\">gel ice packs</a>. If you're flying, this will count as a carry on, so plan accordingly. This is not an ideal method of transporting milk home if you will be traveling for more than five days. Breast milk is good for one day transported in a cooler with ice packs, in the fridge for up to five days, and in the freezer for several months.</p>\n<p>It's a good idea to smell your milk before use. If it smells sour, you need to dump it.</p>\n<h2>3. Automatic and manual breast pumps</h2>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GXKsdH\" target=\"_blank\">automatic breast pump</a> will allow you to pump quicker and more efficiently than the manual handheld versions. I also recommend bringing along a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2qapuxX\" target=\"_blank\">manual pump</a> for when you need relief but can't use your automatic pump.</p>\n<h2>4. Milk storage bags</h2>\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JpyIz8\" target=\"_blank\">milk storage bags</a> instead of bottles to save room in your hotel fridge and cooler, and to make life a little simpler. These can be stored in the freezer, and are much easier to transport than clunky bottles.</p>\n<h2>5. Sterilization bags and wipes</h2>\n<p>Medela makes <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GAok5O\" target=\"_blank\">quick clean wipes</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2q7cHvS\" target=\"_blank\">sterilization bags</a> to make cleaning your pump parts and bottles easy on the go. The wipes are great for cleaning your pump in the airport or at the office, while the sterilization bags can be used in the microwave and eliminates 99.9 percent of germs and bacteria on pump parts.</p>\n<h2>6. Extra batteries and adapters</h2>\n<p>It's a good idea to bring extra batteries for your automatic pump just in case it loses power in a moment when you really need it to work. Having a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2H1nPoU\" target=\"_blank\">breast pump adapter</a> is also very helpful to have on hand.</p>\n<h2>7. A wet bag</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Hc2bMe\" target=\"_blank\">wet/dry bag</a> is a great way to store pump parts after you are done using them. Wet bags are also extremely versatile, and new parents can use them as waterproof storage for dry cloth diapers or anything else that needs to be put away immediately before being cleaned.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>8. Nursing Attire</h2>\n<p>Button down blouses are the perfect career-friendly nursing attire, since they look professional and are easy to discreetly pump in. Wear a hands-free pumping bra underneath so that you can pump and multi-task at the same time. Bring a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JoZ9EO\" target=\"_blank\">nursing cover</a> or fashionable wrap with you if you want more privacy when pumping on the plane or in the airport.</p>\n<h2>Employee rights and breast-feeding</h2>\n<p>If you are traveling for work, know your <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">rights as a new mom</a> at work. Make sure to discuss travel accommodations and your work needs when you're on the road. For example, will your employer provide you with a hotel room that has a fridge or freezer or pay for the delivery of your milk back home? Will your working location have a private room you can pump in and store milk when you are away from your hotel room? How many breaks will you receive to pump? Inquire about all of these things beforehand.</p>\n<h2>Your travel rights</h2>\n<p>Whether you travel for work or for other reasons, it is also important to know your rights when it comes to TSA and flying. First of all, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/BreastPumps/\" target=\"_blank\">FDA</a> considers the breast pump a medical device. Some airlines allow passengers to bring the pump on the plane and not count it toward the carry-on limit. However, other airlines might not be so generous. Know your airlines' guidelines and plan ahead so that you aren't stuck at the gate with more carry-ons then you are allowed.</p>\n<p>In regards to bringing breastmilk on board, <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/special-procedures/traveling-children\" target=\"_blank\">TSA laws</a> are in your favor. Per the TSA, you aren't limited to the three-ounce liquid rule when it comes to breast milk, but you need to declare your milk and supplies. You are allowed to bring a cooler, breast milk, bottles, and ice packs on the plane. Ask the TSA agent to change their gloves before opening up your cooler to inspect the milk. They might swab the outside of the milk bags, but they will not open up the bags. Ask to talk with a supervisor if you have issues.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Fortunately, I realized something wasn't quite right and backed out at the last minute, but there are many people who haven't been as lucky. After a bit of research, I came across dozens of travelers who have fallen for it — one who even lost $30,000 attempting to book a luxury villa for six months. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/what-to-do-about-a-terrible-airbnb-stay?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">What to Do About a Terrible Airbnb Stay</a>)</p>\n<p>Here's how this particular scam works, and what you should always look for when booking through Airbnb.</p>\n<h2>The scam</h2>\n<p>There are numerous ways this scam can occur, but they all start when you begin communicating with the host about a property that seems like a great deal. Perhaps you send them a question via Airbnb, and they ask you to email them instead, as it will be easier or more convenient. Or maybe you've found a property on a different site like Craigslist and you begin with an email conversation. Either way, once you take the communication off the Airbnb messenger, they will begin to hook you in by being helpful and friendly.</p>\n<p>They will answer any queries you may have and tell you a convincing story as to why their property is slightly below market value. Once you reach the stage of being ready to book, they will send you a link to the Airbnb listing asking you to complete the booking through the site as it offers protections for both of you. So far so good, right?</p>\n<p>When you click the link, you'll be taken to a site that looks and feels like Airbnb, and for all intents and purposes seems totally legit. You'll be able to read reviews of the property and enter the dates that you want to book it for, and even the URL will look genuine. You'll then complete the next stage of entering your dates and making a payment to secure the booking. But if you do, you will immediately lose all of the money.</p>\n<p>As a seasoned world traveler, there are subtle differences that I picked up on before paying the $3,000 dollars to secure the property I was interested in, but that many other people might miss. The first red flag was that the property's full address was listed on the property page, but Airbnb only shows the exact address once you've booked and paid. Then I noticed a live chat function at the bottom of the page that I used, but I’m familiar enough with Airbnb that I know it doesn't offer a live chat function. This was clearly not the real Airbnb site.</p>\n<p>The best way to avoid falling for this ruthless scam is to always make sure you book directly through Airbnb, either through their secure app, or by manually entering the URL directly into your browser.</p>\n<h2>Other common Airbnb scams</h2>\n<p>Here are some other common Airbnb scams to watch out for.</p>\n<h3>Advance fee scam</h3>\n<p>This is where someone will offer to give you a discount or something else in return for paying in advance and not using the Airbnb payment method. They'll probably justify it by claiming you'll both save on fees and they'll pass part of that savings on to you. While it may sound great, you'll more than likely lose that money and the payment will be untraceable.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Phishing scam</h3>\n<p>You'll be sent an email that looks as though it's from Airbnb, asking you to click on a link and enter some personal details such as passwords or payment methods. Scammers will then potentially use this information to gain access to your other accounts. Phishing emails can also contain malware that can harm your computer and also be used to record things like passwords to sites you frequent. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-protect-elderly-loved-ones-from-financial-scams?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Protect Elderly Loved Ones From Financial Scams</a>)</p>\n<h3>Wire transfer deposit</h3>\n<p>You'll be offered a fantastic savings on your booking for paying the deposit using a wire transfer service rather than the Airbnb payment process. Once that payment is received, the property will be taken down and you won't receive your money back.</p>\n<h2>Golden rules for booking Airbnb properties</h2>\n<p>In order to remove any potential for being scammed on Airbnb, follow these safety rules every time you book.</p>\n<h3>Keep all communication on the site</h3>\n<p>Never communicate with hosts outside of the Airbnb messaging portal. If they email you or send you a private number to contact them, this should set alarm bells ringing immediately. If they insist on not messaging through Airbnb, cease contact and report them to Airbnb.</p>\n<h3>Read all the reviews</h3>\n<p>Check the reviews carefully and look out for patterns of cancellations or lots of undetailed, poorly worded reviews.</p>\n<h3>Pay on Airbnb only</h3>\n<p>Always make payments through Airbnb and never respond to any requests to transfer money via bank transfer, credit card, or anything else. Paying outside of Airbnb will make it more difficult to trace the payment or prove that it was acquired fraudulently.</p>\n<h3>Look closely at the URL</h3>\n<p>Double check that you are definitely on the official Airbnb site when you're completing your booking. The best way to do this is to type the site name directly into your browser.</p>\n<h3>Don't trust cheap listings</h3>\n<p>Don't trust properties that are advertised at way below market value. While you can find great deals on Airbnb, unfortunately, if it seems too good to be true, it more than likely is. Hosts want their listings to be competitive and priced similarly to other properties in the area. If a property is listed cheaper than it should be and there's not a clear reason why, it's best to avoid the risk and move on.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

I ran to my parents bedroom excitedly exclaiming, \"I got a quarter!\"</p>\n<p>\"Actually,\" my sleepy dad told me, \"You got a 50-cent piece. That's worth two quarters.\"</p>\n<p>I know firsthand that kids can learn a lot about money from the Tooth Fairy, since I did. I also know that my own kids have been able to learn some valuable money lessons based on the under-the-pillow payouts that they've received.</p>\n<h2>1. The values of different coins and bills</h2>\n<p>Like my father before me, I like to provide my kids with unusual coinage when they lose a tooth. My thought was that it makes it seem more magical if they receive a denomination that they never see otherwise. So my husband and I have always slipped Sacagawea golden dollars under their pillows.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is, for years my oldest child hoarded these coins in her room and never spent one. One day she was gathering up all her money and was frustrated that she didn't have enough to buy something. I suggested she raid her trove of tooth money, and she told me that those weren't \"real money.\" We had neglected to tell her that golden dollars were legally accepted currency, and she had gone years thinking that she was exchanging her teeth for mere trinkets.</p>\n<p>Besides using it as an opportunity to introduce unusual coins, you could use the Tooth Fairy's visit as a lesson by alternating between different combinations of coins, so they learn that four quarters equal ten dimes which equal 20 nickels. But good luck slipping 20 nickels under the pillow without waking them up!

How to handle a windfall</h2>\n<p>As an adult, handling a surprise influx of cash can be one of our tougher decisions. It's always tempting to see a windfall as license to spend freely, but then again, a wisely invested windfall could have a vastly different effect on your life than one you decided to blow.</p>\n<p>If allowance is a kids' \"salary,\" Tooth Fairy money is analogous to a tax refund or a Christmas bonus. Let them decide how and whether to spend it, and watch them learn.</p>\n<h2>3. How to make sure you're getting paid fairly</h2>\n<p>Just like sharp-eyed employees at a company, my kids pay attention to what the Fairy pays their siblings. If someone gets more, they do not fail to speak up about it, and the Tooth Fairy seems to get the message, because future payments tend to be more equal. My kids have also had some success in investigating market rates by asking friends how much they get. Once they reported to me that other friends got more money for top teeth, for example, the Fairy started paying a premium for those as well. Lesson learned: It pays to do your research and demand equal pay.

Sometimes money doesn't show up when you expect</h2>\n<p>As a freelance writer, I know the excitement of hearing the mail carrier approach my door, followed by the disappointment of seeing a pile of bills and no checks coming through the slot. Many children will at some point wake up to find that the Tooth Fairy forgot to come. According to a report by Delta Dental, more than half the parents surveyed at some point forgot to leave money under the pillow — which gives children an opportunity to practice their patience and learn that sometimes you have to wait longer than you expected to get paid.</p>\n<h2>5. The spending power of money</h2>\n<p>Just like me with my 50-cent piece, most little children have no idea what their first Tooth Fairy payout can buy. Take them to the store and let them shop. Next time, they'll have a more concrete understanding of what 50 cents or a few dollars is worth. This will help them better budget their allowance once they start earning one.

How to forecast future earnings</h2>\n<p>Most kids lose their first few teeth in kindergarten, at an age when thinking about the future at all is a challenge. As they get older, kids may realize that they can count on a payout every time they lose a tooth. Really canny ones may even consult a medical text or ask their dentist how many more baby teeth they have to lose so they can figure out how much they've got coming to them.</p>\n<h2>7. No pain, no gain</h2>\n<p>Sometimes one of my kids will let a loose tooth dangle by a thread for days because they're afraid of the small amount of pain that might happen if they pull at it. When this happens, sometimes one of the other kids will comfort them by reminding them that they'll get money once the tooth finally comes out. Sometimes it's just the push they need to face the pain.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

If you're in debt, one of the best ways to motivate yourself to get <em>out</em> of debt is by tracking it. Debt tracking websites and apps allow you to create debt payoff plans, calculate how much interest you'll pay in the process of becoming debt-free, and predict the all-holy debt-free date. Many even let you play around to see what the effect of extra monthly payments are.</p>\n<p>There are a ton of free debt tracking tools, but which one is right for you? As a debt blogger, I've spent three years trying and reading extensively about various tools, and have come up with a list of five that I think are best.</p>\n<h2>1. Undebt.it</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.undebt.it\" target=\"_blank\">Undebt.it</a> undoubtedly has the most features of any debt tracker out there. It's the Cadillac of debt-payoff trackers. This comes in especially handy for student loans and credit cards, many of which have helpful (but complicated) repayment schemes and promotional offers.</p>\n<p>Undebt.it also has a number of options for calculating a debt-payoff plan. You can choose from the debt snowball method (lowest balance first), debt avalanche method (highest interest rate first), or even create a custom payoff plan. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/snowballs-or-avalanches-which-debt-reduction-strategy-is-best-for-you?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Snowballs or Avalanches: Which Debt Reduction Strategy Is Best for You?</a>)</p>\n<p>It even supports the <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/get-out-of-debt-faster-with-the-debt-snowflake?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">debt snowflake</a> method of making small, extra payments as you're able. And you can switch among all these plans whenever you want.</p>\n<p>The only downside of Undebt.it is that it's a bit clunky until you get used to it. The full suite of free features is nice, but it does take a bit of time navigating the website to understand all the ins and outs.</p>\n<h2>2. Unbury.me</h2>\n<p>If Undebt.it seems too confusing, try <a href=\"http://unbury.me\" target=\"_blank\">Unbury.me</a>. Its simple block-style layout is pleasing to the eye, and entering debts is a snap. It's almost <em>too</em> simple, which is why this debt tracker works best if your debts are relatively straightforward with no confusing, shifting APRs or payment schemes. Just remember to sign up for a free account after you enter your debt information to save your work, or it'll all be lost as soon as you leave the page!</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. Mint</h2>\n<p>You might be familiar with the popular budgeting software <a href=\"http://www.mint.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mint</a>, but did you know you can use it to track your debt as well? Using its Goals function, click on \"Pay Off Loans\" or \"Pay Off Credit Card Debt.\" It'll automatically populate the screen with your loans or your credit cards, and ask you to input any missing information about your interest rates and minimum monthly payments.</p>\n<p>By sliding the payment toggle, you can instantly see how much interest you'll save by raising or lowering your monthly payment amount, along with how long it'll take you to get out of debt. Select your payment amount, and follow Mint's instructions on where to send the extra payments.</p>\n<p>The beauty of the Mint system is that it updates automatically, meaning you don't have to login and update your account every time you make a payment. Plus, you get all of Mint's extra budgeting tools.</p>\n<h2>4. Debt Payoff Assistant</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/debt-payoff-assistant/id475099959?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Debt Payoff Assistant</a> app is the most basic, no-frills debt payoff tracker. It comes with three payoff plans to choose from: lowest balance first, highest balance first, and highest interest first. You can also come up with a custom plan if none of these work for you.</p>\n<p>Debt Payoff Assistant doesn't really offer much in the way of visualization except for a pie chart that shows you what kinds of loans make up your total debt. If you really want a graph of your debt over time, try Undebt.it or Unbury.me.</p>\n<h2>5. Debt Payoff Planner Calculator</h2>\n<p>If your debt payoff scheme confuses you, consider going with the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/debt-payoff-planner-and-calculator/id1009323715?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Debt Payoff Planner Calculator</a> app. The strength of this app is that it shows you exactly how much money to send to each debt every month, with the amounts changing as you pay off certain debts. You can choose from three payoff plans: the debt snowball plan, the debt avalanche plan, or a custom plan.</p>\n<p>Again, this app doesn't really show you a great visualization of your debt payoff progress. Choose another debt payoff tracker if that's important to you.</p>\n<p>If you're not sure which tracker is right for you, choose a couple to try out for a month or two. The idea is to help you get clearer about what you owe, the best way to pay it off, and to help you stay motivated until your balances are cleared.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Marriage typically involves the joint payment of debts just as it involves collecting joint assets, and everything — both assets and debts — must be distributed in some way when a couple calls it quits. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-protect-yourself-financially-during-a-divorce-or-separation?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Protect Yourself Financially During Divorce or Separation</a>)</p>\n<h2>Community property vs. common law states</h2>\n<p>In a lot of ways, what happens to your debts and assets depends on where you live. If you reside in one of the nine community property states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin) or \"opt in\" for community property in the state of Alaska, then all debts accumulated during a marriage are the responsibility of both parties no matter how they were held. This means that if your spouse ran up a secret credit card balance during your marriage, that debt is your responsibility as well as theirs in a community property state.</p>\n<p>If you live in one of the remaining states, then you live in an equitable distribution state (also known as a common law state). Typically, this means that debt incurred during a marriage is the responsibility of both parties, if both parties were joint owners of an account. If one spouse opens an account in their name only, on the other hand, that debt is their sole responsibility.</p>\n<h2>What happens to debt incurred during separation?</h2>\n<p>Note that debt incurred after a couple separates may be treated differently than debt incurred during a marriage. Your liability for such debt usually depends on your state, whether you took out the debt jointly or separately, and whether the debt was used for, say, a spending spree in Las Vegas or necessities for your children such as food and rent.</p>\n<p>Since the moment of separation is figured differently in different states, the cutoff for new debt can also vary. In some states you need to legally separate while others consider the moment of separation as starting when you begin living apart.

This means the court system that handles your divorce will help you figure out ways to split your debts equally and fairly.

It's possible your credit card issuer may not want to help you move part of the debt into a new account in one spouse's name, although they will usually cooperate if both spouses have good enough credit to qualify for an account on their own.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, Boyle says a <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">balance transfer card</a> can be a good way to split up credit card debt if at least one spouse can get approved. \"It all comes down to whether the card issuer approves or not,\" says Boyle. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-divide-rewards-and-keep-your-sanity-in-divorce?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Divide Rewards and Keep Your Sanity in Divorce</a>)</p>\n<h3>Mortgage debt</h3>\n<p>Mortgage debt is handled similarly to credit card debt, except that there is an asset involved, since mortgage debt is secured by your home. If you own a home together and the debt is in both of your names but you get divorced, then it's possible that one spouse can keep the home. In that case, Boyle says most couples go to their mortgage company and ask it to approve the remaining spouse to refinance the home in their name only.</p>\n<p>If there is equity in the home, there are several ways to split it. If one party keeps the house, they could \"buy out\" the other person with cash. \"You could also refinance the home for what it's worth and get cash out,\" says Boyle.</p>\n<p>Another option is for the remaining spouse to get a home-equity loan and use some of the cash to give the other spouse their share of the equity. A final option is to just sell the house and split the proceeds, notes Boyle.</p>\n<h3>Auto loans</h3>\n<p>What about cars? Auto loans can work a number of different ways. Many times, each spouse will keep the car they drive and take over the payments even if both spouses are on the loan. However, it often makes sense for each spouse to refinance the car loan into their own names when they don't want to continue sharing a joint debt after divorce.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Student loans</h3>\n<p>Then there are <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/does-divorce-affect-your-student-loans?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">student loans</a> to contend with. Boyle says that since student loans are taken out by only one spouse most of the time, the debt is often retained by the borrower. However, there are some exceptions.</p>\n<p>\"I've had situations where a spouse might pay off the other spouse's student loans as part of a broader divorce settlement,\" she says. \"Maybe they were the breadwinner or they had more assets.\"</p>\n<h2>Why couples typically split up debts during divorce</h2>\n<p>Attorney Nicholas Dowgul of <a href=\"http://www.feltonbanks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Felton Banks</a> in Raleigh, North Carolina says couples there occasionally continue holding debt together after divorce.</p>\n<p>Basically, if the parties get a divorce and no equitable distribution action is filed, then equitable distribution (property settlement) is waived by both parties and the debt remains in whomever's name it was, says Dowgul. But if it's joint debt, then it remains the obligation of both spouses.</p>\n<p>However, the problem with joint debt after divorce is that one spouse may not stick to the agreement. In that case, the creditor would likely go after both spouses for repayment, regardless of their agreement to remain jointly liable. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-divorce-and-credit?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">What You Need to Know About Divorce and Credit</a>)</p>\n<p>For example, imagine there's a court order from a North Carolina court that says the husband is required to pay the credit card held jointly by the parties, but he stops paying his part of the bill. The card issuer will hold both spouses liable for the debt and repayment, meaning the bank will come after the wife as well, even though, according to the divorce decree, she's not responsible for paying that credit card bill.</p>\n<p>This doesn't mean that the husband would be off the hook, however. If he agreed to hold the debt jointly during the divorce settlement, then he could be held in contempt of court unless he pays what was ordered, notes Dowgul. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-myths-about-divorce-and-money-debunked?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Myths About Divorce and Money Debunked</a>)</p>\n<p>To avoid situations like this one where one spouse stops paying their share, many couples opt to pay off joint debts and close all joint accounts, then refinance remaining debts in one or the other's name only. It's just too risky to remain in an account with an ex-spouse, especially if you can avoid the situation altogether by moving debts into separate accounts.</p>\n<h2>What can you do to ensure debt is distributed fairly when you divorce?</h2>\n<p>While Dowgul only practices law in North Carolina and believes people in other states should consult a local divorce lawyer for specific advice, he says he recommends his clients write up a separation agreement once they decide they are going to divorce. A separation agreement should include a basic understanding of who gets what after the divorce, including which person is responsible for each debt accrued up to that point.</p>\n<p>In the state of North Carolina, couples have to be separated a year and a day before a divorce is granted, he says. While there's no requirement in his state that couples get their separation in writing, it makes things easier if the parties can at least agree on matters involving debt and assets upfront.</p>\n<p>Finally, hire a divorce lawyer who can represent you and ensure you're left with a fair number of assets and no more than your share of the debts once your divorce is final. \"The goal of divorce is for each spouse to end with assets of similar value,\" says Boyle. \"It's not always a 50/50 split, but it needs to be a fair split.\"</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Congratulations! While planning a wedding and figuring out how to pay for everything can be stressful, you also get to create a wedding registry and select all the gifts you want people to give you. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-save-big-on-everything-for-your-wedding?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Save Big on Everything for Your Wedding</a>)</p>\n<p>While it's fun to scan house decor and that big screen TV you hope one of your guests will be cool enough to buy, cash would be a lot more helpful to you and your soon-to-be spouse. You don't need fancy place settings or sheets with a high thread count, but how can you ask friends and family members to skip the shopping spree and hand over the dough without sounding tacky?</p>\n<p>Here are three strategies that work.</p>\n<h2>Create a specialized registry</h2>\n<p>You aren't the only one who wants cash gifts for their wedding, which is why many online donation registries are available. Sites like Honeyfund and Traveler's Joy allow you to create a wish list of items like a dolphin excursion for your honeymoon or new cabinets for your kitchen in your condo, and your guests can donate money to help you pay for those things. Your wedding guests will feel like their money is going toward a good cause, and you will be able to cash out after your wedding.</p>\n<p>Note that some of these registries will charge you a small 2 to 3 percent transaction or processing fee (and your guests if they use a credit card). Also, many of these registries will take a few weeks to deposit your funds into your bank account, so plan your honeymoon accordingly. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-money-saving-gifts-to-put-on-your-wedding-registry?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Money-Saving Gifts to Put on Your Wedding Registry</a>)</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, don't skip the registry! Some couples think that if they skip the registry altogether that guests will automatically give them cash. Instead, some guests might take this as a sign to give you anything. You might end up with three toasters and floral bedspreads that you would never choose to buy. At least with a registry, you can get items you selected, and you know where to return them if you don't like the gifts. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/alternative-wedding-registry-ideas?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Alternative Wedding Registry Ideas</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Do the dollar dance at your wedding</h2>\n<p>During your wedding, the DJ will announce to the guests that the dance floor is now open for anyone who wishes to dance with the bride or groom. The DJ will also mention that for those who want to help the couple have an extra special honeymoon, this dance is the time to hand over the bills. The \"dollar dance,\" also known as the \"money dance\" or the \"apron dance,\" is socially acceptable and expected in many cultures.</p>\n<p>This dance is extremely awkward, but it also gives older relatives a chance to relish in this special moment and say a sweet word to the bride or groom away from the crowd. My family and my husband's family expected the dollar dance, and even though it made both of us cringe, we are glad we did it. We earned about $400 from the 20-minute dance session, and that moment gave my grandma and aunt a chance to dance and welcome my husband to the family without feeling embarrassed. I thought no one would want to dance with us, but it did end up being a sweet way to thank guests for coming and make them feel noticed.</p>\n<p>However, it is important to think about your guests. Will they think the dollar dance is a fun tradition or would they be offended? For my wedding, we were surrounded by people who just wanted to bless us financially, but we were also a young couple just starting out. Older couples that are perceived to have high-paying jobs might not get the same reaction from their guests if they did a dollar dance.</p>\n<h2>Word-of-mouth</h2>\n<p>Let a few close family members and friends know that while you have a registry, you are also saving money toward a down payment on a house or a kitchen renovation. Ask them to mention this to anyone who asks for registry help or gift ideas. For example, when your old school grandmother asks your mom how to work the registry, your mom can say, \"I can take you shopping this week, but I heard that Jane and Mark are trying to save up for a down payment on a house this year if you would rather contribute the money to that.\"</p>\n<p>The idea is that your wedding guests aren't hearing directly from you that you want cash. You don't want your wedding to feel like a call for money handouts. You also have to realize that many guests might prefer to give checks, but they just don't know how much to give. For example, gifting a nice punch bowl seems more gracious to many people than handing over the cost of the bowl. Word-of-mouth can also help in these tricky situations. Close friends can say, \"I'm just going to give them a $40 check for their honeymoon. I know every little bit will be appreciated,\" when other friends ask what they are gifting.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

As a precaution against tourists overstaying their visas, many countries require that you prove your intention to leave. Usually they pass the responsibility of checking this onto the airlines, meaning you'll probably be asked for what's known as \"proof of onward travel\" when you're checking in at your departing airport. If you don't have a ticket to demonstrate how and when you'll be leaving the country, you may be prevented from boarding the aircraft.</p>\n<p>But what if, like many long-term travelers, you don't have an exact itinerary or solid idea of how and when you're going to leave? Here are six ways to provide proof of onward travel without having to compromise on the spontaneity of your trip.</p>\n<h2>1. Buy a refundable ticket to depart</h2>\n<p>By booking yourself a fully refundable ticket to anywhere outside of your destination, you'll have irrefutable proof that you intend to leave the country when you say you will. Even in the unlikely event that the airline checks your reservation, then you have a ticket that is legitimately valid.</p>\n<p>Print the travel details before arriving at the airport so you have them, if requested. Once you're safely in your new destination, cancel the ticket and redeem your refund.</p>\n<p>This is probably the safest way to provide proof of onward travel, but you need to pay close attention when reading the terms and conditions before finalizing your booking. While some airlines claim to offer refundable tickets, what they actually offer is the price of your ticket returned in voucher or credit form. These tend to only be redeemable with the same carrier, and the cash that you've forked over won't be coming back to you. Also, refundable tickets tend to be significantly more expensive than a regular fare, so be prepared to pay extra up front.</p>\n<h2>2. Book a 24-hour refundable ticket</h2>\n<p>Under the 24-Hour Reservation Requirement, mandated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, all U.S. airlines and foreign air carriers marketing to U.S. customers are obligated by law to \"allow a reservation to be canceled within 24 hours without penalty.\" Many other carriers and flight brokers offer the same terms when purchasing flights with them.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to use this 24-hour cancellation period to your advantage. First, you can book a ticket, wait for your reservation details to come through, and print them off before immediately canceling. You run the risk that the airline you’re flying will check your return reservation and see it canceled, of course, though it's rare they do anything more than look at the documents you provide. If you choose this option, book with a different company than the one you're flying with so it's not as easy for them to check the reservation.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can purchase the onward ticket on the day of your flight so it's valid regardless, and as long as you arrive at your destination within that 24-hour period, you can cancel the departing flight when you land. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-save-money-on-flights-using-fare-alerts?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Save Money on Flights Using Fare Alerts</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Expedia.com offers free one-click 24-hour cancellation on most flights. You don't have to call the airline or talk to a representative, as there's an easy cancel button that will allow you to get a full refund with no questions asked. Just make sure that the flight says \"Free 24-Hour Cancellation\" during the booking process at Expedia.com.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. Use fare rental sites</h2>\n<p>An entire industry has arisen because of the need to provide onward travel, with companies like BestOnwardTicket offering a fare rental. For a fee of around $12, companies like this will purchase your chosen tickets based on the details you provide. They will then automatically cancel them within 24 to 48 hours, depending on the option you select.</p>\n<p>It's similar to booking a ticket yourself, but you don't have to worry about canceling it as that responsibility falls to the fare rental company. There are no concerns around having the funds in place for the ticket in the first place, and you don't have to do anything to secure that refund. You also don't have to spend time looking for a carrier that offers a refund or searching for suitable flights yourself.</p>\n<p>Note that some companies offering this service should not be trusted, so make sure to read customer reviews and thoroughly vet their terms and conditions before paying any fees.</p>\n<h2>4. Get a pre-booked itinerary from a travel agent</h2>\n<p>Pre-booked travel agent itineraries are more commonly used for visa applications where it's important to show not only your onward travel details, but also your timetable for your entire journey. As part of this, many travel agents offer a service where they will hold airline tickets for a certain period of time for you, usually between seven and 21 days.</p>\n<p>It's similar to the fare rental services, but they tend to be slightly more expensive at $35 and up. The benefit of these itineraries is that they can be used by people traveling to multiple countries because you're able to put more than one flight on them. Companies such as Flight Reservation for Visa and Visa Reservation offer competitive services.</p>\n<h2>5. Purchase a cheap ticket</h2>\n<p>In some instances, the most hassle-free option may be to purchase a cheap ticket to another country. It will give you peace of mind knowing you have an authentic ticket in your possession, and depending on where you are in the world, tickets can be extremely low-priced. Budget airlines regularly do flash sales, and many have routes that are always affordable.</p>\n<p>Remember, proof of onward travel doesn't have to be a flight, either, so you have many options to find an affordable ticket out of the country. Bus journeys or ferry crossings are commonly cheaper than flights, and you can often book them online in advance. This option also comes without the inconvenience of having to go through a refund claim.

Sign off</h2>\n<p>Some airlines allow you to sign a contract at the departing airport saying that you don't have valid proof of an onward journey, but you do have means to leave the country. If you arrive at your destination and are turned away by the immigration officers, this contract simply relieves the airline of any responsibility or liability for bringing you into the country, and you'll be required to pay for a deportation flight ticket yourself.</p>\n<p>I recently signed a document like this flying with Air China from Tokyo to Manzanillo, Mexico. Upon arriving at the airport, I was not asked about onward travel and was allowed into the country as usual.</p>\n<p>If you arrive at the airport without proof of onward travel, you may want to speak to a manager at the check-in counter and request to sign a contract that will allow you to risk the journey.</p>\n<p>Note: This is still a risky way to go, because if you don't know the regulations in the country you're arriving in and you do get turned away, it could be a costly endeavor.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Emergency vet bills can quickly make a huge dent in your savings, and that could leave you in a tough spot during an already stressful situation. Can your pet receive the care he or she needs, or will you have to euthanize the animal because you can't afford the treatment? If you plan ahead, you can avoid the latter. Here's how.</p>\n<h2>Get pet insurance while your pet is healthy</h2>\n<p>When my dog, Jaxon, was about a year and a half old, he was admitted to the vet with a respiratory infection that filled his lungs with fluid, which required several nights in the hospital. The bill for the treatment was nearly $8,000, a fee that my husband and I couldn't afford as a young couple in New York City. Unfortunately, we also were unaware that we weren't allowed to leave the hospital without paying the bill in full, and emergency pet care facilities sometimes do not accept payment plans.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, we had insurance to cover it. We paid the full amount to the hospital on our credit cards and then had to wait to be reimbursed by the insurance company (a caveat to consider) after we submitted the claim. But it was a small price to pay to save Jaxon's life. If it weren't for the insurance, we would have had no choice but to put him down at that point. In hindsight, it was a valuable lesson to learn about emergency vet bills and pet insurance, and the life-or-death difference it can make.

So it's a good idea to keep a copy of them at your home so you can grab and go when needed.</p>\n<p>\"If your pet has an ongoing medical condition, it would be best to bring any recent medical records, [and] X-rays with you,\" says Dr. Gary Richter, veterinary health expert with Rover.com. \"Similarly, if the reason for the visit is because the pet got into something that could be toxic, bringing the exact product or a picture of a label is very helpful. The more information you can provide to the team at the emergency clinic, the easier things are going to be.\"</p>\n<h2>Bring some form of payment with you</h2>\n<p>Even if you haven't figured out exactly how you're going to pay the bill, you will need to show some form of payment (especially if you don't have insurance) if you'd like your pet to receive care. Don't leave home without it.</p>\n<p>Most facilities have an initial exam fee, after which they'll provide an estimate for recommended testing and treatment. Costs can range from under $100 to thousands if the pet is in critical condition. You'll then have some time, but perhaps not much time if the situation is critical, to make your decision on what you can afford and how to proceed with the care.

At the very least, you should have enough to cover your pet insurance deductible, but more will likely be necessary if you don't have pet insurance.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>\"If you forgo insurance, you should have at least $2,500 set aside for your pet,\" advises Jme Thomas, executive director of Motley Zoo Animal Rescue in Redmond, Washington. This is, sadly, really hard for a lot of people to do, but instantly when your dog gets hit by a car, that's pretty much what you're looking at to start — not even for the ongoing care and treatment. We feel that's a slightly conservative estimate [for the actual care], but a relatively typical amount for an emergency fund.\"</p>\n<h2>There are credit options specifically for these emergencies</h2>\n<p>If you're in the hospital with your pet and you're trying to figure out how to pay for the bill, CareCredit could be an option for you. You can apply for this medical assistance credit line in advance, possibly at your veterinarian's office, or online, just so you have it on hand when the emergency arises. You can also do it at the emergency vet's office at the time, if needed.</p>\n<p>Your qualification for this card is based on your credit situation, like any other card would be, so you can't have a terrible score, Thomas says. But it's not as harshly critical of your score as, say, a mortgage lender would be.</p>\n<p>\"This is what saves a lot of people's pets in the end,\" she adds.</p>\n<h2>Don't let emotion control the situation</h2>\n<p>You want to save your pet, there's no doubt about that. But one practical question you need to ask yourself when your pet has an emergency is if going into debt for the treatment is worth it. That may seem harsh, but you need to keep a roof over your own head if you want to be able to afford caring for another living creature.</p>\n<p>Adds Dr. Richter, \"When people are faced with these kinds of choices, they need to weigh the costs with the pet's prognosis and how spending the money will impact their lives. An excellent long-term prognosis — broken leg, for example — may warrant spending the money, whereas end-stage terminal cancer is a more difficult decision.\"</p>\n<p>In the end, it's your decision, but you shouldn't compromise your ability to provide for yourself. It defeats the whole purpose.

Making sure you’ve got a strong internet connection and plenty of power can be challenging on the road. Without those, your productivity will suffer, which could cost you big bucks. Here are four tech add-ons to stock up on before your next trip that can save you both time and money.</p>\n<h2>Wi-Fi range extender</h2>\n<p>If you're working while traveling, you probably spend a significant amount of time holed up in your hotel room, hunched over your laptop. Or if you're taking a well-earned vacation, you might choose to relax by streaming a movie or listening to some music. The problem comes when you find yourself confined to a room that's far from the router with a patchy signal. The speed can slow so much that it feels like you've gone back to the days of dial up.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there are devices that allow you to seamlessly connect as if the router was right next to you. <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oQxR1R\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi range extenders</a> increase the coverage areas and boost the strength of slow connections in areas farther from the router. All you need is the network's password, and to be at least on the edge of the signal to set it up. Most hotels offer free Wi-Fi to their guests (or for a small fee), so you should have no problem getting their network password. Vacation rentals will most likely include this for you to use, as well.</p>\n<p>There are two main kinds of Wi-Fi range extenders available. One plugs into a wall socket and picks up the signal from the router by amplifying it and then transmitting it again. This allows anyone with the password to access the extended network, so it's the preferred kind to use if you have multiple devices, or if there is more than one person who needs to use the Wi-Fi connection. However, it does mean that you need access to a wall socket, which may be difficult depending on where you are.</p>\n<p>The second type is a mini antenna that plugs directly into the USB port of your laptop. It will pick up a weak signal and turn it into a strong, consistent connection. The benefit of this model of Wi-Fi extender is that you don't need a wall socket to use it — making it more convenient when there isn't one available. However, it will only work for the device it's plugged into, and many models only connect to laptops, meaning your phone or tablet will still be out of commission.

Smartphones have become indispensable traveling tools that enable you to do anything from booking accommodation and searching for directions, to downloading your boarding pass or ordering an Uber.</p>\n<p>But, virtually all of your entertainment devices require a charged battery to function. Whether it's an e-reader, a tablet, a camera, or a Bluetooth speaker, they all need to be juiced up to be of use while you're on the go.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oUWU3w\" target=\"_blank\">portable charger, also known as a power bank</a>, can help you avoid a dead battery while you’re out and about. You can charge your devices on the go, instead of needing to be chained to a wall socket while waiting for your devices to charge.</p>\n<p>Power banks come in all shapes and sizes, and hold varying amounts of power. Tiny, lipstick-sized power banks will fit in your pocket, while the highest capacity models are understandably more bulky, but can power anything up to the size of a laptop. You can even get solar powered power banks, which will convert the sun's rays into battery juice.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Portable Wi-Fi router</h2>\n<p>If you're a frequent traveler who is constantly connected to the internet, then a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oUKEA5\" target=\"_blank\">portable Wi-Fi router</a> may be a good investment. Essentially, it's a router that works like any other, allowing you to wirelessly connect multiple devices at the same time. The difference is that a travel router accesses the internet through a tethered cellphone, using a sim card and USB cord. You can create your very own private Wi-Fi network anywhere there's cellular coverage, whether you're on the beach or lounging by the pool.</p>\n<p>The best portable Wi-Fi routers are unlocked, so you can pick up a cheap local sim card in whichever country you're in. Or, you can purchase a global sim that gives you coverage across several countries, but these are often more pricey than a local sim. If you're going to a country where you're able to use your regular data package, like Mexico, you can even use your existing sim card.</p>\n<p>Beware, though: Not all portable Wi-Fi devices are created equal. This is particularly true in regards to speed, as some are capable of providing standard 3G, right up to 4G+ connectivity to allow super quick downloads. They also come in different sizes, the most practical of which can easily fit in your pocket.

They're usually over in milliseconds and occur multiple times per day in electrical circuits all over the world.</p>\n<p>There are two main types of power surges that occur, with multiple potential causes. First, there are surges sparked by outside events, like storms, lightning strikes, or compromised power lines. Unfortunately, these are usually very strong and there's not much you can do about them.</p>\n<p>Then there are surges that arise inside, usually caused by faulty electronics or when high-powered electrical devices are in use. The demand that elevators, refrigerators, or even hairdryers momentarily put on an electrical circuit can result in a potentially devastating power fluctuation.</p>\n<p>There are many countries across the globe where the power supply simply isn't as advanced or reliable as it is in the U.S. If you want to prevent having your precious electrical devices fried by an unexpected power surge then you need to add a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2HfMWAH\" target=\"_blank\">travel surge protector</a> to your packing list.</p>\n<p>It plugs into the wall socket like a standard travel adapter, and you plug your devices into it. The surge protector acts as a barrier to stop any electrical spikes from cooking your electrical gadgets, saving you the potential inconvenience and cost of replacing them.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

They can throw the perfect party together seamlessly and effortlessly. From having the most delicious food, to amazing decorations, and of course, the best guest list, they make party planning look easy-peasy.</p>\n<p>More often than not, however, the best parties comes with a hefty price tag. Hiring event planners, DJs, and caterers, can cause party costs to get out of control quickly. Fortunately, you don't have to spend thousands of dollars for a memorable party. With a little creativity and planning, you can throw a party that will keep your guests raving for years.</p>\n<h2>1. Start a party fund</h2>\n<p>First order of business? Create a budget.</p>\n<p>Parties become expensive quickly if you don't have a predetermined budget. And the worst part is, you could spend too much on one aspect of the party (like drinks) and not have enough for another important component (like decor).</p>\n<p>Start by determining how much you plan to spend on the whole party. Then divide it up into categories, such as food, decor, invitations, entertainment, and other. Next, set a realistic limit to each category. You can do this in a simple Excel spreadsheet or on paper. As you purchase items for the party, be sure to keep track of every expense.</p>\n<h2>2. Ask for help</h2>\n<p>Planning a party can be stressful, but you don't have to do it alone. Instead of hiring an expensive event planner, ask a friend to throw the party with you. He or she can take some of the burden and expenses of party planning.</p>\n<p>Have a friend who is an incredible baker? Ask him to make desserts. Know someone who has the best taste in music? See if she can make the party playlist to keep everyone entertained all night long. Outsourcing doesn't just help make your life easier, it also allows other people to join in on the party planning process. Plus, it's way cheaper to solicit the help of friends than it is to hire a professional.</p>\n<h2>3. Get creative with decor</h2>\n<p>No party is complete without decor! While decorations are what really brings a party theme to life, you don't have to blow your budget. You can save money by looking at what you already have around the house.</p>\n<p>Instead of buying multiple centerpieces (that you might never use again), try mixing a variety of vases, figurines, and decorations from around your home. Or, hit up the dollar stores for affordable candles and votives. Have a mishmash of china at home? Theme your party around that and mix and match all of your decorations for a whimsical vibe. If it's an outdoor party, hang up some cheap cafe or christmas lights to create a cozy feel. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/12-ideas-for-cheap-festive-fall-decor?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12 Ideas for Cheap, Festive, Fall Decor</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Supply cheap food</h2>\n<p>As the party host, no one is expecting you to serve a five course, Michelin star-worthy meal. The key is to keep your food simple and appealing to everyone.</p>\n<p>If you're cooking yourself, consider making easy batch meals, such as pasta, tacos, chili, or BBQ. These types of foods are easy to batch-cook and are liked by most people. To add a creative flair, set it up as a station so guests can add their own toppings and create their own dish.</p>\n<p>If you're not a cook, you can still cater meals while on a budget. The trick is to reach out to casual, smaller restaurants or catering companies. They are more likely to cut you a deal and allow you to personalize your menu.

Set up games</h2>\n<p>Who says entertainment has to be expensive? There are plenty of ways to keep your guests occupied and having fun without spending an arm and a leg.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>For an outdoor party, set out a few yard games such as cornhole, croquet, or horseshoes. Everyone loves these classic games, and it's an easy way to bring guests together.</p>\n<p>And if you're throwing an indoor dinner party, it's still a good idea to keep some games in mind, such as Pictionary and charades. You never know how late guests will want to stay or when there might be a lull in the party. Having a few games on hand can be your saving grace. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-board-games-for-adults?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 5 Best Board Games for Adults</a>)</p>\n<h2>6. Rethink booze</h2>\n<p>If you choose to provide alcohol, the costs can add up quickly. It's a slippery slope because everyone tends to have different preferences as to what they drink. You risk overspending by trying to purchase alcohol to fit everyone's tastes.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can get creative with booze. Instead of providing a full bar, choose some staple liquors and offer several mixers like juice and soda. Also, most people will be happy with a selection of beer or wine. On the invitations, you can let guests know what alcohol you're providing, and encourage them to bring their own beverage if they prefer something different.</p>\n<p>Or, if you're throwing a themed party, a signature drink can fit the bill. Create a themed cocktail and whip up a big batch for everyone. Not only is this cheaper, but it allows you to step away from playing bartender all night at your own party.</p>\n<h2>7. Create a playlist</h2>\n<p>No need to hire an expensive DJ or band for the perfect party. Create the perfect ambience by arranging your own playlist through Spotify.</p>\n<p>Throwing a dinner party? Classical, low-key music can provide the ideal background noise. Backyard barbeque? Try throwing in some country and pop hits. You can create your own playlist or use one of many preset playlists offered on Spotify.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

At the time, I had just opened my baby son's 529 account with a check from his grandparents, but it hadn't occurred to me to do a monthly transfer. I checked our finances to make sure we could spare $130 per month, and set up an automatic transfer.</p>\n<p>It's been over seven years, and that monthly transfer is still going strong. When my younger son was born, we figured out a way to afford transferring $130 per month to his 529 account, too.</p>\n<p>I'm sure the man I was sitting next to had no idea his throwaway remark would have such a profound effect on my kids' college savings accounts, but this experience proved that wanting to \"keep up with the Joneses\" can often be a good financial decision. I wanted to keep pace with another parent, so I worked to make sure my savings rate matched his.</p>\n<p>Though keeping up with the Joneses often gets a bad rap, this sort of financial competition can help you save money and make better financial choices. Here's how to make it work for you.</p>\n<h2>Understanding anchoring</h2>\n<p>Part of the reason why the spending habits of others can be such a powerful trigger for financial decisions — both good and bad — is because of a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-mental-biases-that-are-keeping-you-poor?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cognitive bias known as <em>anchoring</em></a>. This quirk causes us to latch onto a the first number or price point we hear as the \"normal\" price for something.</p>\n<p>For example, in the case of my 529 contributions, hearing the other parent say he puts aside $130 per month anchored that amount in my mind as an appropriate monthly contribution. Had he said that he put aside $30 or $350 per month instead, my anchoring bias would have latched onto those numbers as the contribution amount to strive for.</p>\n<p>You often see anchoring working against your financial health when you compare yourself to the Joneses. Let's say that instead of 529 contributions, I had been discussing monthly car payments that day. If someone had told me they spent $650 per month on their car payment, that amount would have become the number I initially thought to be a reasonable amount to spend each month. With a $650 per month anchor, I might have ended up getting a far larger car loan than I could afford because my mental anchor was very high.

Instead of feeling as though you are not measuring up — as you would if comparing yourself with a peer who earns more or has more than you do — you will do a kind of aspirational comparison, where you think about how you can become more like your role model. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/4-money-lessons-you-can-learn-from-the-joneses?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4 Money Lessons You Can Learn From the Joneses</a>)</p>\n<h3>Figure out average spending among your peers</h3>\n<p>The website <a href=\"https://statusmoney.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Status Money</a> allows you to see how your finances compare with those of your peers, anonymously. This can help you understand which budget categories you're overspending on based on what is considered average, rather than based on any one individual. While a friend or family member can throw your sense of what's appropriate to spend out of whack, seeing what's average among all of your peers can give you much more clarity.</p>\n<h2>Choose your friends wisely</h2>\n<p>We all have friends who spend money like it's going out of style, and it's easy to feel like you need to keep up. And then there are friends who seem to egg you on to make purchases you don't need.</p>\n<p>While there's nothing wrong with staying friends with these sorts of high rollers, it's important to recognize the effect they have on your budget, and make plans accordingly. Plan on seeing spendy friends in environments where you can't spend money — like at dinner parties or on nature hikes — so that the temptation to keep up is removed entirely.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, surround yourself with people whose money habits you'd like to emulate. Then you'll feel no conflict between your desire to save and your desire to please your friends, since those two things will be in alignment.

But knowing exactly how much people save or how little they spend can give you a helpful metric for managing your own finances. The trick is to recognize when to use the example of the Joneses, and when to ignore it.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Walk up to someone roughly the same height, say \"Hey, wanna be best friends?\" and congratulate yourself on another buddy in the bag. Try that line as an adult and the reactions will range from a bizarre stare, to a quick 911 call. It can be tough making new friends, and most of the time the people we meet at work are our best shot. However, because you're in a professional environment and need to see these people every day, you want to keep a respectful distance, at least at first, until you get to know them well enough.</p>\n<p>Here are some ideas on how you can make friends at the office without making things awkward.</p>\n<h2>1. Seek out people with similar interests</h2>\n<p>Finding a shared passion is one of the fastest ways to find a new friend. Whether it's a love of baseball, comic books, or camping, when you start out both loving a certain pastime, you have a great foundation to build from. But how do you identify the coworkers who have the same interests? Well, you can start by taking advantage of the kitchen (if you have one). Hang out there while you drink your coffee, join in on the conversations that happen, and casually bring up your own hobbies. You can also leave flyers, especially if you're starting something like a softball team or book club.

Attend all work events</h2>\n<p>Some work events will be company-sponsored; others will be arranged by colleagues who want to hang out after work. If you avoid these chances at more relaxed socializing with coworkers, you're denying yourself the opportunity to make a real connection. So attend the company picnic, the pot-lucks, the team-building outing to a local axe-throwing club, and of course, happy hour. Most company employees like to hang out after work for a few adult beverages, chewing the fat and relaxing after the rigors of the day. Join in.</p>\n<p>And if you're the sober one, and the designated driver, the bar staff will usually give you free sodas and energy drinks through the night to support you.

Eat lunch with a group, not at your desk</h2>\n<p>Make it a point to eat lunch with people you like, as a group, at least a few times a week. If you can afford it, heading to the local lunchtime eatery is another fun way to make friends. Plus, as you're not in the office setting, it can be more relaxed.</p>\n<h2>4. Bring in breakfast</h2>\n<p>Breakfast doesn't have to be an expensive gesture. A box of donuts costs about $10, and most people will love the thought and effort you put into it. You could also arrange a schedule, so that a group of you are alternating breakfast duties throughout the month. Even if you're extremely busy, there's always time for a five-minute break to eat a donut and have a coffee.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>5. Take advantage of social platforms</h2>\n<p>The biggest social network for business is LinkedIn, and it's usually easy to track down your coworkers and connect with them on that site. You can leave messages, or post shout-outs to team members who did a stellar job during the week.</p>\n<p>Once you get comfortable interacting on LinkedIn, the next step is to reach out through Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. This is a depper step into your colleague's personal life, so don't rush this one. Some people like to draw a line between business and pleasure, even in this age of sharing everything online. And as always, keep it appropriate. It may be social, but if you start ranting about a crappy day at work, don't expect your coworkers to have your back. They know these posts can be picked up by management and plenty of people have been let go due to social media missteps.

Ask your coworkers for help</h2>\n<p>If you're new to the company, this is a great way to get closer to people you see as potential friends. They know the ins and outs, and they will be more than happy to help the green employee. By asking for help on a project or task, you show a more vulnerable side, and when egos are small, big friendships can grow.</p>\n<h2>7. Exude confidence</h2>\n<p>If you're shy and lack self-esteem, you'll struggle to make meaningful friendships. Relax. Think about all of your good qualities. What makes you great at your job? What makes you a great friend? Pump yourself up, and it will really help you make connections.</p>\n<h2>8. Show off your personality</h2>\n<p>If you have the ability to do so, turn your workspace into an advertisement about your interests and hobbies. If you're the world's biggest Harry Potter fan, celebrate Hogwarts with some desk toys. Love football? Drape the team colors. Can't wait to go paintballing? Put up some event posters and photos of you in your gear. And if there's a like mind in the office, they'll hear about your interests and seek you out.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Think about your life, and write down what you think would help make your pregnancy more comfortable and how you can incorporate more of that into your routine. Then do it.

Avoid Google</h2>\n<p>Pregnancy can be a time of high anxiety because you don't want to do anything that will hurt your baby. It comes with all sorts of new physical sensations and experiences. When something feels different, or you have a question, it's natural to want immediate resolution by finding the answer yourself.</p>\n<p>The problem with the internet, though, is that you hear about a lot of worst-case scenarios, and you expose yourself to a lot of untested information. This can cause anything from annoyance to outright panic. Instead of going to Dr. Google, find a real doctor, midwife, or doula you can trust. When questions pop up, call them instead.</p>\n<h2>3. Get more rest</h2>\n<p>Due to hormonal changes, most women feel more tired than usual, especially during the early days of their pregnancy. Instead of pushing through this, take it as in indication of what your body needs: more rest. By prioritizing rest, you'll not only give your body the energy to grow a baby, but you'll also put yourself in the best possible place to be able to approach your pregnancy with a calm and clear mind.

Find or create a calming space</h2>\n<p>Is there a place that instantly puts you at ease? This can be anywhere from your bedroom or garden, to the local library or the spa. Wherever this place is, spend as much time there as possible while you're pregnant. You can even create a cozy space by adding your favorite books, candles, and lots of warm blankets and pillows.</p>\n<p>Even if you can't actually go to your peaceful place because of work or other daily responsibilities, take some time regularly to visualize yourself there. Visualization can be a powerful tool, and can change the way we perceive reality. While you may not reap all the benefits of actually being somewhere relaxing, you might find yourself less stressed. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-ways-self-care-can-actually-save-you-money?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Ways Self Care Can Actually Save You Money</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Take a hike</h2>\n<p>Exercise is always good for lowering stress, and it can be especially helpful when you're pregnant. Make sure that you consult your doctor about any exercise routines you haven't yet tried but, unless you're on bedrest, taking a walk is almost never a bad idea. And 30-60 minutes of walking each day can help release endorphins in your brain, which will make you feel happier, more relaxed, and able to tackle any challenges that come your way.

Take time to enjoy your pregnancy</h2>\n<p>If you're feeling nervous or your pregnancy has brought up a lot of unknowns about your future, it can be hard to feel anything but dread. Set aside some time each day to remember why being pregnant is worth whatever you're going through in the moment. Soon, you'll have a child to love and nurture, and you'll get to watch them grow up. You should also keep in mind that your body is doing something truly incredible while you're going about your day. You're creating a life inside your body. That's amazing. And there are women all over the world who have gone through it, and are going through it now — so you can find comfort in knowing you're not alone in this process.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

They are the smooth-talkers who always manage to say the right thing to get exactly what they want. Where most of us are at least somewhat fearful about the idea of negotiation, these people seem to enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Negotiating can be especially challenging for introverts, not because they lack confidence, but because negotiations can have a confrontational tone, and often require some posturing and bluffing — which are not communication tools introverts typically use. Though introverts may be less comfortable with the act of negotiating, they have many strengths that can aid them in the process. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-smart-money-habits-of-introverts?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Smart Money Habits of Introverts</a>)</p>\n<p>No one is born a good negotiator. Negotiation is a skill, and it takes a lot of practice. And here are six ways introverts can become stellar negotiators. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-negotiating-skills-everyone-should-master?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Negotiating Skills Everyone Should Master</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Research and prepare</h2>\n<p>Introverts tend to flourish when they have researched and prepared in advance. By researching, you armor yourself with the facts. This is vital, because you no longer have to rely on your opinion or emotions, both of which can be difficult for introverts to openly share.</p>\n<p>Figure out what the going salary is for someone in your location and with a similar level of experience. Collect data from multiple reliable sources. Then create a list of everything you've accomplished in the last year. If you've saved the company a significant amount of money, for example, be sure to include that in your documentation.</p>\n<h2>2. Consider the outcome</h2>\n<p>Think about how the other party might potentially respond to your negotiation request. For example, if you are asking for a raise, how will you respond if they agree? What if they disagree? What if they completely blow you off?</p>\n<p>Assess every possible outcome and how you will handle it. Consider what you're asking for. Do you have a bottom line? What would be the bare minimum you hope to gain from having this conversation?</p>\n<p>Nothing is worse for an introvert than being thrown for a loop, so be realistic and plan for the unexpected.</p>\n<h2>3. Cut to the chase and ask</h2>\n<p>So many opportunities are missed because people aren't sure how to ask for what they want, or are too afraid. Share your data, get to the point, and ask for what you want. If the other party doesn't agree with your terms, it is likely because they either didn't believe the facts, or they don't have enough resources to sustain your claim. Either way, you never know what you can gain unless you ask.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Show them how it's mutually beneficial</h2>\n<p>Make your case for why you deserve what you're asking for, but also be sure to include what they'll gain by giving it to you. A successful negotiation will showcase how this proposition will benefit both parties. If it's a promotion you want, for example, point out how you'll increase the bottom line, or improve the company in this new role. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/6-reasons-introverts-make-the-best-employees?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Reasons Introverts Make the Best Employees</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Don't forget to pause</h2>\n<p>Typically, introverts love to take their time to think about what they're going to say before they say it. Because of this, any long pauses or any unexpected questions can instill a fear of the unknown. Long pauses, however, can be used to an introvert's advantage.</p>\n<p>If someone asks you a surprising question, don't hesitate to pause before you respond. While you're gathering your thoughts, the other person may even offer further explanation or clarification, buying you extra time to make your point. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-everyday-situations-that-introverts-ace?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Everyday Situations That Introverts Ace</a>)</p>\n<h2>6. Practice, practice, practice</h2>\n<p>Rehearse everything, from how you will enter the room, how you'll greet the other party, and how you plan to take hold of the conversation. Avoid going into in-depth explanations as to why you want what you want. Stick to the facts.</p>\n<p>It might feel somewhat silly to practice your negotiation tips, but the more you rehearse, the more your confidence will grow. Notice if you're fidgeting, stuttering, or speaking unclearly. Remember, keep your responses short and to the point to clearly communicate what you're asking for.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

In romance, in friendships, in business — loyalty typically wins. But when it comes to brands, blind loyalty can actually be a bad thing. Stand by your brand? Always and forever? I don't think so. Here are six ways brand loyalty costs you money. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-we-brainwash-ourselves-into-brand-loyalty?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How We Brainwash Ourselves Into Brand Loyalty</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. It prevents you from discovering new products</h2>\n<p>Consumers who rigidly stick to one particular brand never discover what else it out there (and let's face it, there's <em>always</em> something else out there). With that degree of loyalty, you may miss out on new products or more efficient options that can save you money in the long run. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-grocery-store-habits-that-are-making-you-broke?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Grocery Store Habits That Are Making You Broke</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. It discourages price comparison</h2>\n<p>From cellphone carriers to bulk cereal, brand loyalty discourages objective price comparison. If you never consider other options, you miss out on special promotions, deep discounts, and other money-saving opportunities.</p>\n<p>Venture beyond your go-to brands. In the grocery store, compare the unit price of products and the value that generics and store brands offer. For services such as cable, internet, and phone, check out new providers who may have more flexible pricing options. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-generic-beauty-buys-better-than-the-expensive-originals?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Generic Beauty Buys Better Than the Expensive Originals</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. It limits flexibility</h2>\n<p>Though brand loyalty works best when it's voluntary, many companies prefer something a bit more binding. Think about brand-specific software, tech accessories that aren't universally compatible with other devices, and smartphones that lock out all carriers but one. Are the manufacturers nurturing loyalty by supplying a superior product or service, or are they simply benefiting from a captive consumer base? Remember, when a brand limits your flexibility, it limits your opportunity to save. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-smart-ways-to-save-on-smartphones?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Smart Ways to Save on Smartphones</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Store brand credit cards may not offer the best terms</h2>\n<p>Store cards or co-branded credit cards may make you feel like you're part of an exclusive club, but they don't always offer customers the best terms. Many charge an annual fee, impose higher than average interest rates, and offer limited options for reward redemption. Unless you shop frequently at a particular retailer, store cards can't beat cards with more flexible rewards programs. Instead, choose a general <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-cash-back-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">cash-back credit card</a> with a competitive interest rate and no annual fee. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-store-card-pitfalls-to-watch-out-for?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Store Card Pitfalls to Watch Out for</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Loyalty and reward programs trade nominal savings for big data</h2>\n<p>Loyalty plans and retail reward programs don't give you discounts out of the goodness of their hearts; they trade it for detailed data on your buying habits. In turn, that data is analyzed to cross-sell similar products, suggest accessories and upgrades, and predict what you'll buy in the future. Once you sign up, you become part of an alarmingly sophisticated marketing machine — one that's designed to sell you more products more often. Where's the savings in that?</p>\n<h2>6. Many membership benefits don't last</h2>\n<p>Building brand loyalty is an expensive endeavor. Perks, upgrades, and discounts are used strategically to draw new customers into rewards programs. However, those benefits cost money and don't always last. Once your loyalty is firmly in place, privileges have a way of gradually disappearing.

Do you catch yourself daydreaming about exciting adventures in faraway lands? If you're suffering from wanderlust, then a world trip might just be the cure.</p>\n<p>Planning a trip around the world is a daunting task, even if you're a frequent traveler and have incredible organization skills. It often takes months of research to get to the stage where you're ready to board that plane and take to the skies. So to help you get ready to for the adventure of a lifetime, here's a step-by-step guide to planning your world trip.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Pick which countries you want to visit</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-wisely-choose-your-next-travel-destination?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Choosing where you want to go</a> is the first step of the planning process, as it provides you with focus and inspiration to follow through on your dream trip. But more importantly, knowing the countries you want to visit will determine everything else. It will help you decide how long you're going to spend in each place, the route you take, and how much to budget.</p>\n<p>If you're even considering a trip around the world, then you've probably got a long list of destinations you're desperate to explore. There's no right or wrong way to do this, it's just a case of writing down all of the places you want to visit so you can start to plan around them. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-international-destinations-anyone-can-afford?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 International Destinations Anyone Can Afford</a>)</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Start planning a route</h2>\n<p>Now that you have a list of potential destinations, it's time to start connecting them into a viable route. Unfortunately, at this stage you're probably going to drop a few spots from your list, as it just won't be feasible to include them all.</p>\n<p>Remember that the fewer places you visit, the less money you'll need to dedicate to transportation getting to each location, meaning your budget may stretch further. It'll also mean you'll get to spend more time in each place.</p>\n<p>The best way to plan your route is to pull out a large map and place pins in all of the destinations on your list. You should start to see clusters of destinations that are close to each other and how you might be able to move from one to the next.</p>\n<p>When mapping out your route, it's important to take the weather of each place into account. Check the seasons beforehand as this may alter the direction you travel in and when you go. You should also consider whether there are any specific festivals or events that you're hoping to attend. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/savor-your-trip-and-save-big-with-these-5-slow-travel-tips?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Savor Your Trip and Save Big With These 5 Slow Travel Tips</a>)</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Create your budget</h2>\n<p>Once you have a rough idea of the route you'll take, you can start figuring out how big your budget needs to be. Check travel blogs and guidebooks to give you an idea of the costs for each destination you want to visit. You should also look at accommodation sites to see the price of a room during your chosen travel dates.</p>\n<p>You can then break it down into a daily budget for each location, multiply it by the number of days you expect to spend in each place, and add them together to get your total. It's important to create separate budgets for each country rather than just a blanket daily allowance, as costs can vary wildly from place-to-place. Remember to include transportation, accommodations, food and drinks, as well as things like Visas and border fees.</p>\n<p>How large your budget is will depend a lot on your personal style of travel. Whether you stay in luxurious hotels or budget hostels, and whether you plan to fly everywhere or are happy to travel by train or bus will have a significant impact on how much you'll need. Be realistic about the level of comfort you require while traveling and understand that you'll generally have to pay more for better amenities.

From there, you can then transfer smaller amounts into an account with card access. So if your card is stolen, the thieves will only have access to a small amount. Because of the potential difficulties of getting new cards on the road, it's also a good idea to have more than one account that you keep virtually empty, but can transfer money into if need be.

Make sure you do your research and apply ahead of time for the ones that require you to do so. Some countries are notoriously difficult to secure visas for and it may only be possible to do so from your home state, so check this prior to buying a ticket.</p>\n<p>Your passport needs to be up-to-date with at least six months to cover the end of your trip, as many countries won't let you in with any less time left than that. You also need to have enough pages left for all of the stamps and visas you're going to acquire, and most countries require a minimum of three full pages. It's worth doing a quick calculation to ensure your passport will last you to the end of your journey and not see you turned away at any borders.

For example, if you're planning on <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-get-to-machu-picchu-and-back-for-30?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">walking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu</a>, there are a limited number of visitors allowed to do so each year. Because of this, you need to book around six months or more ahead to secure everything. Events and festivals will mean that accommodations get booked up quickly as well, so you should have this in place long in advance.</p>\n<p>Booking in advance can be an excellent way to help manage your savings and budgeting as well, as things will already be paid for prior to setting off. However, spontaneity is one of the real joys of traveling the world, so having a rigid schedule will detract from that. Allow yourself some flexibility to stay longer or change your plans if you want.

Do you have any recurring bills that you need to automate or cancel? Are you planning to sell off belongings before your trip to raise extra funds? (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-sell-all-your-stuff-and-travel-the-world?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Sell All Your Stuff and Travel the World</a>)</p>\n<p>There are plenty of things you'll need to get in order at home before you leave, and the earlier you start the less stressful it will be. Make a list of everything you'll need to do and spread the tasks out leading up to your trip.</p>\n<h2>Step 8: Get vaccinated</h2>\n<p>Staying healthy on the road should be your main priority, as lots of countries are affected by diseases and illnesses that we just don't get here in the U.S. Find out what vaccinations you need as soon as you have your route figured out, so you can get them done in plenty of time. There are even some countries that won't let you in without proof that you've had certain vaccinations, most commonly for yellow fever.</p>\n<p>If you take any medications, you should also put a plan in place to ensure you have enough to last the duration of your trip. You should also research whether you're going to be able to purchase that medicine in each location you're in, whether you need a prescription, and how easy it is to obtain. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-ways-to-stay-healthy-on-vacation?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Ways to Avoid Getting Seriously Sick on Vacation</a>)</p>\n<h2>Step 9: Buy travel insurance</h2>\n<p>Lots of people take a chance by heading abroad without <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-times-travel-insurance-is-worth-it?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">travel insurance</a>, but when you're going on a longer trip, it's just not worth the risk. Get a solid plan that will cover you for health costs, travel cancellations, lost luggage, and anything else you need covered. As with any insurance, make sure you double check the fine print to ensure it's suitable and worth the cost.</p>\n<h2>Step 10: Pack wisely</h2>\n<p>Packing for a world trip can be a huge task, as knowing exactly what to take and what not to can be extremely confusing. Start by looking at the places that you're visiting, the climates you're going to be experiencing, and the activities you're going to be doing. These three things will help to determine what should go into your luggage. Remember, you're able to get anything virtually anywhere in the world, so rather than overpack, it's better to underpack and pick up things as you go.

Though to many this sounds like an improbable career path, there's a growing number of people out there doing just that and making it work. Instagram has become a veritable gold mine for thousands of enterprising travelers looking to cash in on their daily adventures. But how exactly do the people behind these successful pages manage to do what they do? Here's how.</p>\n<h2>1. They have to grow an engaged following</h2>\n<p>To make money from Instagram, it's essential for Instagrammers to have a large, engaged group of fans who like and comment on their content, and keep coming back for more. While some accounts explode overnight, the vast majority of successful Instagrammers have spent years cultivating this following through hard work and dedication.</p>\n<p>The first step is to settle on a niche that you love, and while travel is a niche, it's still too broad. You could use a gimmick like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/muradosmann/\" target=\"_blank\">@muradosmann</a>, whose hand-holding pictures created an entire genre, or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/agirlandhervan/\" target=\"_blank\">@agirlandhervan</a>, who shares all of her travel adventures in her van.</p>\n<p>The next step is to post regularly, which means once a day or more and at similar intervals. This is so followers get accustomed to seeing your content and look out for it at times when they know it will appear. Many Instagrammers also create Instagram Stories, which are quick videos (similar to the Snapchat format) that allow them to reveal much more personality than the photos allow.</p>\n<p>Since it's a social media platform, it's also essential to be social. Particularly when building their following, Instagrammers reply to comments, like and comment on other people's stuff, and generally make themselves a visible presence on the platform.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the top Instagrammers place a huge focus on <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-simple-ways-to-take-stunning-travel-photos?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">producing high quality images</a>. Though this doesn't necessarily mean using a fancy camera, as smartphone cameras are now high quality, it does mean posting well-composed photographs that tell a story, that represents their chosen niche, and are consistent in their look and feel.</p>\n<p>Instagrammers with a large, interactive following are referred to as \"influencers\" and have become a key part of many marketers' strategies. It's at this stage that it becomes possible for Instagrammers to start leveraging their audience to make money. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/earn-extra-income-with-your-smartphone-camera?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Earn Extra Income With Your Smartphone Camera</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. They undertake sponsored campaigns</h2>\n<p>Creating sponsored campaigns with companies in the travel industry is a lucrative way for Instagrammers to monetize their accounts. Tourism boards, travel insurance providers, rental car companies, airlines, and more companies regularly organize marketing campaigns that rely on Instagram influencers.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily the two parties will work out an agreed number of posts that relate to the company's aims and services, and a theme or overall message they want to promote. The amount the Instagrammer is paid depends on the length of the campaign and the amount of work that goes into it, but can be anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand. Alternatively, some companies offer all-expenses-paid trips in exchange for this work. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-turn-your-instagram-account-into-a-paying-gig?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Turn Your Instagram Account Into a Paying Gig</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. They create sponsored posts</h2>\n<p>These are far easier to set up than full campaigns and tend to require a single Instagram post. Often they can be a simple review with an accompanying photo featuring the product or service. When it's a product, like a watch, or travel gear, the Instagrammer will typically keep the product in question and receive a fee on top of this for the review.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. They become brand ambassadors</h2>\n<p>Brand ambassadorships are long-term partnerships between an influencer and a brand that fits well with their niche and that naturally lends itself to their audience. They're more akin to the sponsorships that, for example, sports stars have with sporting goods manufacturers. In exchange, the influencer is bound to promote the brand regularly during that agreed upon time frame.</p>\n<p>If it's a clothing brand, for example, they will send the influencer their new collection or key pieces from it each season. The Instagrammer will then promote the new line by modeling the clothes and tagging the brand a certain number of times. Because brand ambassadorships are longer term, they're a great way for Instagrammers to build a regular income.</p>\n<h2>5. They implement affiliate marketing</h2>\n<p>Affiliate marketing can be done as part of a brand ambassadorship deal, or independently by the influencer through their own affiliate partnerships. Affiliate marketing programs allow them to receive a percentage of every item or service sold on their recommendation or referral. This works best with an extremely engaged and loyal following, as it depends entirely on followers immediately acting on the recommendations of the people they follow.</p>\n<p>It also helps when the influencers are able to offer discounts to their followers to encourage them to purchase, like $20 off a weekly meal subscription box, for example. Referrals are calculated by using an individual tracking code that needs to be input at the point of purchase, or via a tracking link that does this automatically when someone clicks on it.

They teach others how to do the same</h2>\n<p>Many successful travel Instagrammers have turned their individual model of success into its own side business. By selling their knowledge of how to make money traveling the world, other people can follow in their footsteps and use those secrets to do the same thing. This can be in the form of workshops, online courses, or speaking at seminars and conferences.</p>\n<p>They can also use their knowledge of the platform to help businesses grow their following and use Instagram to its full potential to maximize their reach, and ultimately sales through consulting. The profiles of Instagram stars act as their resumes and demonstrate their experience and expertise on the platform.

However, that's not to say you can't have a good time on the way to your next destination. On most international itineraries, you can stop in a city for up to 24 hours without it counting as a destination. That means that you typically don't have to pay more, in dollars or miles, to stay somewhere overnight.

The ideal layover city has several key qualities. First, it has to be an interesting city that's worth visiting. Also, you'll want to have popular attractions located relatively close to the airport. Furthermore, it always helps when the airport is accessible with public transportation. Here are seven fun cities to spend up to 24 hours in during a layover.

Seattle, Washington</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>This northwestern city is now a hub for Delta as it and several other carriers offer numerous daily flights to Asia. From the Seattle-Tacoma airport, or \"Sea-Tac\" as the locals call it, you can take the Link light rail service to downtown in about 45 minutes. Once there, you can tour the famous Pike Place market, visit the Aquarium, or go on a whale watching cruise. Other downtown attractions include the Museum of Pop Culture, and of course, the iconic Space Needle.</p>\n<h2>2. Denver, Colorado</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>You might not consider this to be a major international hub, but the Mile High City now offers 26 international flights to destinations such as Tokyo, London, Munich, Paris, Zurich, and Iceland. And if you're lucky enough to have a layover here, you can to take the commuter rail straight from the airport to downtown's Union Station in just 40 minutes. There, you will arrive within a few blocks of the Elitch Gardens amusement park, Coors Field, and the REI flagship store. Hop on RTD's free 16th Street shuttle bus, and you can visit the Colorado State Capitol, the Denver Museum of Art, and the lower downtown dining and entertainment district.

Miami, Florida</h2>\n<p></p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Miami is an American Airlines hub and a major gateway for several airlines that offer service to Latin America and the Caribbean. It also offers convenient Metrorail service from the airport to downtown. Once downtown, you can visit Miami Beach, tour the Art Deco Historic District, or visit the spectacular Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. Other attractions include the Miami Seaquarium and the Jungle Island wildlife park.</p>\n<h2>4. Atlanta, Georgia</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>With over 103 million passengers in 2017, Hartsfield-Jackson International is actually the busiest airport in the world, and a major international gateway. Better yet, the local MARTA train system offers convenient service to downtown in just about 20 minutes. Attractions there include the Georgia Aquarium, the World of Coca Cola, and the College Football Hall of Fame. Other notable sites include the CNN Center, the Center for Civil and Human Rights, and the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library.</p>\n<h2>5. London, England</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>This major international hub is a common stopover destination. From London's Heathrow airport, you can take the Heathrow Express train to Paddington Station in just 30 minutes. Or, you can take the standard tube to nearly any part of the city. The famous sites are too many to list, but they include Big Ben, Parliament, the Tower of London, and dozens of museums.

Singapore</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Changi Airport is a famous destination in and of itself. Walking though its terminals, you feel like you could be in a mall. But if you need to see the city, feel free to take one of the free tours offered by the airport. If you have more time, visit the Gardens by the Bay, the Singapore Flyer, the S.E.A Aquarium or go shopping along Orchard Road.

Frankfurt, Germany</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Frankfurt might not be Europe's most exciting destination, but it can make for a quick, fun stopover. The airport itself has several hotels near the terminals and offers airport tours. You can also take the train into downtown, where you can find a historic old city center and take a scenic walk along Rhine River.

It's even nice to enjoy the bright summer weather and green panoramas throughout the countryside. But come fall, there's a new breathtaking sight: brilliant reds, yellows, and oranges that paint the hillsides in an entirely new light.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to see these changes is by going on a fall leaf-viewing road trip across the U.S. It doesn't necessarily have to be a drawn-out affair (unless you want it to be); even a few miles will do if you pick the right spot. Even better, it's the perfect affordable travel option, as you can bring your own packed meals and enjoy a picnic along the way. Here are the six best foliage drives throughout the U.S. that are worth checking out this fall.

Colorado's Peak-to-Peak Scenic Byway</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Rocky Mountains are already one of the most scenic vistas in the world. But when you add in splashes of fall color from the Aspen trees, it turns into a gorgeous view that'll send shivers down your spine.</p>\n<p>The Peak-to-Peak highway runs 55 miles from north to south. It starts in the north in the scenic town of Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountains National Park, and heads south through Blackhawk and Clear Creek Canyon down to I-70. Along the way, you'll pass several stop-worthy destinations, such as Nederland (with its most famous resident, the \"frozen dead guy\"), Eldora Ski Resort, and more hiking trails than you can shake a stick at. For best leaf-color viewing, head out in late September to mid October.

New Hampshire's Kancamagus Highway</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>New England is legendary for its fall colors since almost the entire region is blanketed in a swath of deciduous forests. But if you want the best of the best, northern New Hampshire's Kancamagus Highway (pronounced \"kank-ah-mah-gus\") is where you should point your vehicle. The first two weeks in October is the best time to drive this route.</p>\n<p>This 34.5-mile drive won't take you too long to complete, but why not spend a bit more time in the area and stop along the way? There are <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/10-most-breathtaking-day-hikes-in-the-us?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">plenty of hiking trails</a> for friends and family members of all abilities, and at least four different waterfalls to explore along the way. If you keep your eyes peeled, you might even spot some of the area's secretive wildlife, such as bears, deer, and even moose.

Michigan's M22</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>This 116-mile stretch of road has been voted by numerous newspapers and websites as one of the most scenic drives in America. Once peak fall colors hit during the first week in October, however, it takes on a whole new level of beauty. M22 snakes through scores of quaint cottage towns along the coast of Lake Michigan, starting in the south at Manistee and working its way along Michigan's little pinky finger to Traverse City, the cherry capital of the world.</p>\n<p>Make sure to stop at the Empire Bluff Trail (1.5 miles round trip) for an amazing photo of blood-red trees meeting a set of high bluffs that curve around a perfect view of Lake Michigan. There are also several lighthouses along or near the route, such as the Point Betsie lighthouse and the Grand Traverse Lighthouse.</p>\n<h2>4. Washington's Cascade Loop</h2>\n<p></p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>The Cascade Loop is a 440-mile long odyssey, and you're sure to find plenty of adventures along the way. For many people, the loop starts just north of Seattle in Everett, Washington, before skirting up near the famous San Juan Islands. From there, it heads inland and parallels the Canadian border before dipping back down near the 55-mile-long Lake Chelan. The route then heads back to its starting location, but not before passing through the idyllic Bavarian-themed town of Leavenworth. Other notable stops include Wallace Falls State Park, with its namesake 265-foot waterfall, and the wild west-themed village of Winthrop.</p>\n<h2>5. North Carolina and Virginia's Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blue Ridge Parkway is long: 469 miles, to be exact. It also snakes through a wide range of different elevations, slopes, and environments, so you'll definitely see some color somewhere along the way between early October and early November.</p>\n<p>The Parkway starts at Rockfish Gap in Virginia, and winds its way south to Cherokee, North Carolina. Make sure to stop and get a photo of the iconic Mabry Mill, a historical Appalachian sawmill, or check out one of the many bluegrass concerts that take place throughout the year.</p>\n<p>If you'd rather stretch your legs a bit more after the long car ride, you'll be delighted to hear that there are over 369 miles of trails off of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Many of these trails head back to scenic waterfalls — perfect for the budding photographer in you.</p>\n<h2>6. California's Wine Road</h2>\n<p>If you're a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-cheap-travel-destinations-for-wine-lovers?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">wine lover</a>, there's no better place to visit than California's Wine Road. Rather than a single, official route such as the Peak-to-Peak Scenic Byway or the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Wine Road is more of a loose collection of wineries and lodging options located throughout California's famed Sonoma County. The Wine Road helps guide travelers through the backroads and byways to almost 200 individual wineries and 54 lodging options.</p>\n<p>You could spend months exploring the area, however fall is one of the most beautiful times to visit. The vines pass from shades of green, on to gold, and finishing up with bright reds.</p>\n<p>As if that wasn't enough, fall is harvest time in wine country, and it's the subject of much ado. You can check out the Wine Road's farm-to-table dinners, harvest parties, crisp vineyard hikes, and, of course, wine tastings. All of this can get expensive if you're not careful, however you can purchase a one-day <a href=\"https://www.wineroad.com/events/ticket-to-the-wine-road/\" target=\"_blank\">tasting pass</a> that'll give you access to tasting three different wines at 60 different wineries, for a mere $35.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

The heat of the summer is over and the hot water feels great against the chilly air. But even though it's cold, it's not so cold that you'll get frostbite after you leave the pool, like during the winter.</p>\n<p>Hot springs can run the gamut from hoity-toity, historical playgrounds of the rich and famous to undeveloped natural upwellings in the middle of nowhere with a trail to lead you there.</p>\n<p>These six hot springs fall right in the middle — not super spendy, but they also offer more amenities for maximum relaxation. For a true frugal hot springs visit, pack your own meals and drinks for a poolside picnic and check out these six beautiful locations. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/4-affordable-autumn-destinations-for-nature-lovers?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Affordable Autumn Destinations for Nature Lovers</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Thermopolis Hot Springs in Thermopolis, Wyoming</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>At first glance, Thermopolis Hot Springs looks like something otherworldly. The pools are fed by a spring that drips over a gigantic, cascading wall of mineral buildup (known as the Rainbow Terraces) that resembles a scene from prehistoric times.</p>\n<p>The entire hot springs is contained within Hot Springs State Park, which charges a reasonable $6 entrance fee ($4 if you're a Wyoming resident). Once in, you can visit the historic State Bath House and the pools for free. There's even a herd of wild bison that live in the park, which the staff feed daily at 8:30 a.m. during the late fall and winter (a great time to see them).</p>\n<p>There are several affordable lodging options nearby. You can find rooms right in town for under $100, as well as a plethora of <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/a-first-timers-guide-to-using-airbnb?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Airbnb private cabins</a>, homes, and campsites nearby also for under $100 per night. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/9-simple-ways-to-save-on-hotel-stays?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">9 Simple Ways to Save on Hotel Stays</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Riverbend Hot Springs in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico</h2>\n<p>New Mexico can get scorching hot in the summer. But come fall, you can enjoy a gorgeous vista of the red rock mountains right from a pool at Riverbend Hot Springs, located smack dab on the banks of the Rio Grande.</p>\n<p>These hot springs are perfect for couples looking for a romantic getaway, as the Riverbend Hot Springs Resort has a strict \"whisper-only\" policy around the pools, and small children are only allowed in certain areas. You can even reserve private pools that are clothing-optional starting from $30 per hour, if that's how you roll. Otherwise, you can get a one-hour pass to the common pools for $12 per hour.</p>\n<p>Riverbend Hot Springs itself offers lodging starting from $94 per night for an \"artist room,\" or $146 per night for a \"budget double.\" If you book a room at the resort directly, you'll also get a free pass to use the common hot spring pools, or you can book a private pool at a 33 percent discount.</p>\n<h2>3. Kirkham Hot Springs in Lowman, Idaho</h2>\n<p>Kirkham Hot Spring is a bit of a local secret, and a destination ripe for adventurers. It's less developed than many other hot springs — it's literally just a cascading, hot pool in the forest — but it is located within a campground inside of Boise National Forest. The campground offers vault toilets, drinking water, trash cans, and picnic tables. There is a short trail to get to the hot springs that can be steep and slippery for some folks, so bring your hiking shoes.</p>\n<p>The best way to experience this rustic hot springs is by making a <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/kirkham/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70634\" target=\"_blank\">camping reservation online</a> so that you don't even have to travel far to get back to your cozy tent. Rates start at $15 per night, and there is a $5 day-use fee if you don't plan on camping here and instead park at one of the picnic sites. One final heads-up: Because it's a less-developed hot spring, the campground (and therefore the hot spring) closes each October 31 and reopens the next year on April 1.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Breitenbush Hot Springs in Detroit, Oregon</h2>\n<p>Be prepared for a tranquil, yet hippie-like retreat at this hot spring. It's owned and run by a member co-op, all of whom live on-site. Since this is a remote lodge, there are few other alternative lodgings nearby. However, lodging at the resort is relatively affordable, ranging from $72-$165 per person, although you will need to bring your own bed linens (heads-up: you may be asked to bunk with a roomie if you show up solo). Lodging does include meals, however the options will be vegetarian and organic.</p>\n<p>If you'd rather just visit the hot springs and not stay on-site, there's a $22-$38 per-day fee, and you'll need to make reservations in advance. This may also be another spot to leave the kids at home for. While kids are allowed on-site and in the pools, the hot springs themselves are all entirely clothing-optional.

Quapaw Bath and Spa in Hot Springs, Arkansas</h2>\n<p>The Quapaw Hot Springs is located right within the thriving town of Hot Springs, Arkansas. There are many options for lodging, including over 30 local Airbnbs for under $75 per night or three-star hotel rooms starting at $129 per night.</p>\n<p>More of a \"spa\" than a \"hot spring,\" this one is a perfect choice if roughing it on algae- and mud-covered rocks isn't your style. It's owned and operated by a resort that has channeled the hot springs into a series of indoor pools. Spa services cost extra, but if all you want is a simple soak, it'll cost just $20 per person.</p>\n<h2>6. Strawberry Hot Springs in Steamboat Springs, Colorado</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's hard to complete any hot springs list without including one from Colorado. After all, the state boasts around 30 hot springs. Strawberry Hot Springs is one of the best, however, because it offers an affordable, rustic-yet-not-<em>too</em>-rustic experience.</p>\n<p>A day pass for the hot springs costs $15, and includes access to the pools, restrooms, picnic areas, and heated changing areas. Although there are plenty of lodging options available in nearby Steamboat Springs, you can stay on-site in a whimsical covered wagon for just $70 per night, or a rustic cabin for $85 per night.</p>\n<p>Although two-wheel-drive cars are fine during the summer months, it's better to plan on using a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get up the road in the fall and winter, just in case there's snow or ice on the road. If you don't have access to such a vehicle, no worries — two different shuttle services will drive you up for $45 per person.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

It's possible to have virtually any kind of experience you're after in the U.S., but many people believe it to be more costly than heading abroad on a vacation.</p>\n<p>Sure, it's possible to spend a fortune on a five-star hotel and business class flights, but there are also plenty of affordable ways to explore this breathtaking country.  (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-european-cities-you-can-visit-for-50-a-day?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 European Cities You Can Visit for $50 a Day</a>)</p>\n<h2>Opt for low-cost accommodations</h2>\n<p>If you're not careful, accommodations can unnecessarily eat up a huge chunk of your travel budget. It will likely end up being your largest expense (unless you choose free options), so it's vital to tackle this first to bring costs down.</p>\n<h3>Airbnb</h3>\n<p>Airbnb is particularly great as an <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-cities-where-airbnb-is-way-cheaper-than-a-hotel?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">alternative to hotels</a> in major cities — which tend to be far more expensive. The cheapest way to use Airbnb is to use the private room feature. This allows you to book a room in someone's house rather than having to shell out for an entire place of your own. You'll have the added benefit of being able to use the kitchen facilities, which can save you tons on food costs. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/a-first-timers-guide-to-using-airbnb?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">A First-Timer's Guide to Using Airbnb</a>)</p>\n<h3>Couchsurfing</h3>\n<p>This is by far the cheapest option when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/13-ways-to-get-free-travel-accommodations?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">finding budget accommodations</a>, because it's absolutely free. It's best to try and plan couchsurfing far in advance, as it's unsurprisingly a popular service, and can get booked months ahead. Another thing to keep in mind is that it's mainly available in big cities, so you'll need to plan accordingly if you're heading to a more rural area.</p>\n<h3>Camping</h3>\n<p>Campsites can cost as little as $5, but if you want to save even more, there are plenty of options for dispersed camping (aka wild camping) that are absolutely free. Wild camping is widely available on Bureau of Land Management land and in National Forests. It could also open up a cheap way to visit National Parks, as much of this land lies directly beside National Park sites. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-find-free-campsites-in-the-us?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Find Free Campsites in the U.S.</a>)</p>\n<h2>Nosh on a budget</h2>\n<p>Food is reasonably cheap in the U.S., so keeping yourself fed and watered shouldn't cost an arm and a leg. However, there are ways to keep your food costs down.</p>\n<h3>Cook your own meals</h3>\n<p>Dining in fancy restaurants three times a day is clearly going to bust your budget, so it pays to pick and choose when you eat out. Buying your own groceries and cooking for yourself is by far the most effective way of saving money on food while traveling. This is another reason why hotels are a less cost-effective option than Airbnb, couchsurfing, or camping, as they generally do not provide a kitchen.</p>\n<h3>Find cheap restaurants</h3>\n<p>With a little bit of Googling, you can find fantastic cheap restaurants in virtually any part of the U.S. These can be fast food restaurants, diners, or chain restaurants that offer good value for their menu prices. You can also find special offers like weekly deals, <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/best-kids-eat-free-restaurants?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">kids-eat-free discounts</a>, or offers on the restaurant's app to cut down the total even more. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/20-fast-food-apps-that-help-you-score-free-food?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">20 Fast Food Apps That Help You Score Free Food</a>)</p>\n<h2>Find free or affordable activities</h2>\n<p>There's so much to see and do across the 50 states that it would be a real shame to miss out because of a lack of funds. However, there are fun, free attractions throughout the country if you know where to look.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Google, Google, Google</h3>\n<p>Search for the location you're headed to with the key term, \"free things to do in\" and the results will most likely turn up numerous offers. Not everything will be your bag, but you'll certainly come across a few gems no matter where you are. From free museums and art galleries, to one-off events and festivals, you'll probably be surprised at what you can do without spending a dollar. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/47-free-things-to-do-across-the-us?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">47 Free Things to Do Across the U.S.</a>)</p>\n<h3>Buy a National Parks pass</h3>\n<p>If you're a nature lover, your travels across the U.S. will likely include visiting a National Park or two. If the ones you plan to visit charge entrance fees totaling more than $80, then purchasing a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/passes.htm#CP_JUMP_5088574\" target=\"_blank\">National Parks pass</a> is going to save you money. Plus, it will give you entrance to every single park and, national forest, and Bureau of Land Management site for an entire year.

These can be a great way to save money on an action-packed couple of days and are well worth checking out before arriving at your destination.

Before you leave, however, make sure you get the car inspected to ensure it won't break down in the middle of nowhere.</p>\n<p>You'll have to budget for gas, and these costs can add up quickly, especially in an area where gas prices are high. To cash in on this common budget buster, use a credit card that offers <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-best-gas-rewards-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">cash-back or bonus points for gas</a>. That way, even if you do end up spending a lot on gas, you'll make some of it back via rewards.

By renting, you can guarantee that the car is going to run well, and you can also choose a fuel-efficient model, reducing your gas costs. This option works well for shorter trips, and depending on the rental deal, it can be better than using your own car.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

You're going to quit your job and become a digital nomad. You've seen scores of people on social media living and working in exotic locations and making it look completely effortless, so why can't you do the same? You'll be as free as the wind, live in whichever exciting destination tickles your fancy, and earn a living online as you go.</p>\n<p>Many people have this idea that the lifestyle of digital nomads is carefree and spontaneous, but that's not quite accurate. While the digital nomad lifestyle is undoubtedly within reach for plenty of people, it actually takes a huge amount of planning to be successful. Being <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-live-the-location-independent-lifestyle?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">location-independent</a> has its pros and cons, and it's important to weigh them all in order to see if it'll work for you.</p>\n<p>One of the most important steps is to put a solid financial plan in place before setting off. The last thing you want is to be stuck in a foreign country, struggling to make ends meet with no contingency plan or idea of how to turn things around. Here are four steps you need to take to create a smart financial plan tailored to the digital nomad lifestyle.</p>\n<h2>Create a nomad fund</h2>\n<p>Setting money aside is a wise step for any big change you're going to make in life, and becoming a digital nomad is no exception. Inevitably there are going to be relocation costs for travel to your chosen destination, visas, vaccinations, and typically a deposit and first month's rent on accommodations.</p>\n<p>You're also going to want a <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/7-easy-ways-to-build-an-emergency-fund-from-0?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">financial safety net</a> in the event that things don't go according to plan. This should cover the cost of a ticket home on short notice, living expenses following a downturn in income if you lose a client or job, or unexpected medical bills. There's no magic number to aim for, and the exact figure will be different for each person depending on their circumstances.</p>\n<p>From here, you should estimate what you think your ongoing costs will be so you can make a realistic monthly budget. With a little bit of research, it's easy to find the cost of living in most places. Sites like <a href=\"https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living\" target=\"_blank\">expatistan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/\" target=\"_blank\">numbeo</a> provide good indications for what to expect, and many travel blogs have detailed sections on suggested budgets for several destinations.

Rather than being limited to where your place of work is, you can find somewhere that suits you, and also allows you to cut costs.</p>\n<p>However, one of the main considerations for where you live will undoubtedly be the quality and speed of the internet available to you. This means you'll probably need to choose more of an urban setting over rural areas, which may cost more.</p>\n<p>Luckily, since you don't have many possessions when you're on the road, you won't need a large house or apartment to put them in. Smaller spaces generally cost less money to rent, which will reduce your monthly costs. Since you're reducing your expenses and living with less, you might choose to work less, you may opt save or invest more, or perhaps you'll decide to maximize your standard of living. It's always nice to have options.

Whichever camp you fall into, it's of paramount importance that the physical objects you do keep are of good quality. This is particularly true when it comes to your work equipment.</p>\n<p>Though it might require a large initial cost, investing in quality gear should mean it will last a long time. It should also mean you don't need to constantly upgrade if your equipment requirements change. For example, you may be tempted to buy a basic and affordable laptop, but you might outgrow its functionality within a year, and you'll have to fork over more money to replace it.</p>\n<p>For digital nomads, the equipment necessities include a quality laptop, and a reliable smartphone, as these will be crucial to your traveling office. View this as a long-term investment in your business and make sure you have the essentials in place before you leave.

Who you pay them to, how you go about filing them, and whether you need to pay them at all. Don't fall victim to ignorance as it could cost you dearly with the IRS.</p>\n<p>As a U.S. citizen, it's important to understand that no matter where you go in the world, you will always need to file your taxes in the U.S. regardless of whether you're based there or not. It's one of the few countries in the world that bases taxes on citizenship rather than residency.

In fact, in 2016, over 11 million Americans went on a cruise vacation. There's a reason why cruises are so trendy.</p>\n<p>\"Cruising is an awesome vacation as far as getting a good bang for your buck. You get lodging, transportation to foreign countries, and food all at one low price,\" says Lance Cothern, a personal finance blogger at Money Manifesto and cruise aficionado.</p>\n<p>Still, cruises can be intimidating for the uninitiated. What exactly is included? How do meals work? Aren't the cabins small? What about seasickness? And for Pete's sake, how much is alcohol going to cost?</p>\n<p>Fear not. I spoke with cruise experts Joel Parker, from Financial Freedom Community, and Lance Cothern to get the scoop on what you need to know. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/5-most-affordable-cruise-lines-for-families?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Most Affordable Cruise Lines for Families</a>)</p>\n<h2>Select your cabin carefully</h2>\n<p>The cabins on cruise ships are generally divided up among these types, in order of highest to lowest cost:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suites</li>\n<li>Veranda cabins with private balconies</li>\n<li>Ocean view cabins with windows or portholes that you can't actually open</li>\n<li>Interior cabins with no views</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For those looking to save a few bucks, Parker recommends skipping the expensive veranda cabins unless you'll be in a position to use them well and often.</p>\n<p>\"My most recent cruise only had two days at sea and the premium veranda room went unused. However, on our other cruise, we had several days at sea and used the veranda almost every day,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Unless you book a highfalutin' suite, chances are your cabin will be smaller than you're used to with a traditional hotel room. You don't necessarily need to skimp on packing, but now's definitely not the time to bring your entire collection of fine china.</p>\n<p>Additionally, cruise ships get creative with the design of the rooms. For example, most cabins come equipped with two twin beds, regardless of how many people will be sleeping in the room. Couples can push these together to form a bigger bed. The bathroom might also come with a clothesline or bar that you can use to dry bathing suits. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-get-a-cruise-cabin-upgrade-for-free?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Get a Cruise Cabin Upgrade for Free</a>)</p>\n<h2>Food will be plentiful</h2>\n<p>There's good news and bad news when it comes to food on cruises.</p>\n<p>First, the good news is that free food at designated restaurants and all-you-can-eat buffets is included with your cruise fare. This is usually pretty standard American food, like hamburgers, hot dogs, and barbecue. You can even take this food back to your room with you, although you can't take it off the ship in an attempt to save on food while on shore excursions.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that premium restaurants like steakhouses, Italian trattorias, and sushi joints typically aren't free. You need to pay out of pocket for those. Furthermore, since the free places are … well … free, they tend to get crowded, especially during regular mealtimes.</p>\n<p>To get around this, Parker advises to \"make dining reservations in advance so you can avoid being locked out of the free sit-down restaurants.\"</p>\n<p>Now, more bad news: alcohol and even soda generally aren't free (although free soda is included on Disney cruises), and they can be expensive on the ship. However, \"most cruise lines allow you to bring on a 12-pack of soda per person and a 750 mL bottle of wine if you like,\" says Cothern. It's a good idea to check your cruise line's policy before you do this, just to make sure.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you may also be able to purchase an all-you-can-drink package at the beginning of the cruise. This may be a cheaper option if you plan on buying a lot of drinks, but make sure to read the fine print and run the calculations so you know if it really is a deal or not.

That's where shore excursions come into play. When the ship docks in a destination, often you'll be allowed off the boat for fun activities.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Most people book shore excursions through the cruise line itself. However, budget travelers can do better than that.</p>\n<p>\"Don't just immediately book your excursions through the cruise company,\" says Parker. \"You can typically find the exact same excursion for less by booking direct, or in many cases, find alternative, better experiences through a different company.\" Websites like TripAdvisor and Expedia can clue you in to good tours and allow you to book them for cheap.</p>\n<p>The catch here is that if you go it alone, you're responsible for your own safety and getting back to the ship on time. Sometimes, the ship clock and local time can be different, so make sure to set your watch to ship time and try to get back at least an hour or two early so the cruise doesn't leave you behind.</p>\n<p>In addition, getting on and off the boat isn't always a speedy process. After all, it takes a lot of work to funnel hundreds or thousands of people through limited entryways. Make sure to budget this time into your plans as well.</p>\n<h2>Be prepared for seasickness</h2>\n<p>A lot of people worry about getting seasick while on cruises. It's a fair concern. Most cruises, however, have stabilizers built in for a smooth ride (they do have swimming pools and tubs on board, after all), although you still may feel a bit queasy, especially if you encounter a storm or rough waters.</p>\n<p>It's recommended to always bring Dramamine or other seasickness remedies on board, just in case. There will be medicine available on the ship and there is a full medical team on board as well. If you're prone to seasickness, a good place to book a cabin is in the middle of the ship on a lower deck, since this is the most stable place on the ship.

That doesn't mean it's entirely worry-free or cheap, however. By doing your homework ahead of time with your specific cruise line and following these tips, you'll be well on your way to enjoying your first cruise.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

There are plenty of ways to save money when seeing the country's biggest attractions. In fact, you can see most of them for $0. If you're looking for amazing things to do on a budget, check out this list of 47 free things to do across the U.S. of A.</p>\n<h2>1. Geek out at the New York Public Library in New York City</h2>\n<p>You don't have to be a bookworm to get a thrill out of visiting New York Public Library, although the hundreds of thousands of books will certainly excite you if you are. The building's classical interior is absolutely breathtaking, they run free tours, and you can also get a glimpse of the Rose Room, famous for <em>that </em>scene in the original <em>Ghostbusters</em> movie. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/8-free-things-you-can-do-on-any-vacation?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Free Things You Can Do on Any Vacation</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Gaze upon the bright lights of Times Square in New York City</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the most famous landmarks in New York, Times Square is probably best visited after dark to ensure you get the full effect of the giant neon billboards that surround it. This larger-than-life square has a great atmosphere, thanks to the thousands of people enjoying the sights. Take a camera and some snacks and soak up the electric ambience.</p>\n<h2>3. Visit the African Burial Ground Monument in New York City</h2>\n<p>The African Burial Ground Monument was created after the 1991 discovery of numerous caskets during the beginning stages of the construction of a federal building on the site. They contained the remains of over 400 African people, both free and enslaved, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Learn the history at the fascinating and informative visitor center and memorial.</p>\n<h2>4. Chill out in Central Park in New York City</h2>\n<p>In the middle of Manhattan lies possibly the most famous park in the U.S., if not the world. This vast oasis allows you to forget that you're even in a city, let alone the largest metropolis in the country, and there are plenty of things to see and activities to get involved in. You can also take a self-guided tour with one of the free downloadable guides they provide that take you to the park's most famous spots.</p>\n<h2>5. Walk the High Line in New York City</h2>\n<p>Converted from a former rail line, New York's High Line is one of the coolest and attractive parks in the city. Running 1.45 miles from the north of Chelsea to the Meatpacking District, this beautiful elevated slice of nature is a wonder to behold. Colorful flowers and greenery are interspersed with works of art, not to mention the breathtaking views of the Big Apple's magnificent skyline.</p>\n<h2>6. Take the Staten Island Ferry in New York City</h2>\n<p>Shuttling between Lower Manhattan and Staten Island since 1817, this historical route is way more than just a neat boat trip. The Staten Island Ferry not only provides its passengers with unparalleled views of the Manhattan skyline, but the 25-minute journey also glides right below the Statue of Liberty. It's also absolutely free.</p>\n<h2>7. Visit the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.</h2>\n<p>Showcasing the history of flight through various objects ranging from historic aircraft and spacecrafts, to uniforms and objects gathered from space, this museum is a riveting day out. Take a flight in a realistic simulator, learn the science behind space exploration, and watch various demonstrations put on by the staff throughout the day. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/how-to-visit-museums-for-free?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Visit Museums for Free</a>)</p>\n<h2>8. Marvel at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pay your respects to one of the most important figures in U.S. history with a visit to the grand Lincoln Memorial. Located in the National Mall, there are also plenty of other points of interest to discover nearby. Rangers are on hand between 9:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. to answer any questions, and you can also join one of the hourly talks they run at no cost.</p>\n<h2>9. Tour the White House in Washington, D.C.</h2>\n<p>Home to the current President and at the center of political life in the U.S., the White House needs no explanation. But what you may not know is that you can do a self-guided tour of the famous landmark for free. It's not as simple as just showing up, and must be booked in advance, but it's certainly worth the effort to secure a slot.</p>\n<h2>10. Get star-struck on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles</h2>\n<p>Anyone who's anyone in the entertainment business has one of the legendary stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Take a stroll alongside Tinseltown's most distinguished names, from old favorites like Marilyn Monroe to modern megastars such as Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.</p>\n<h2>11. Immerse yourself in modern art at The Broad in Los Angeles</h2>\n<p>At The Broad in downtown L.A., you'll find an incredible collection of modern art with familiar names ranging from Lichtenstein to Basquiat. Admission is free, but it's advised to book tickets online, especially during peak times. There's even a free app that includes digital tours for guests to access.</p>\n<h2>12. Gaze at the stars at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>This gorgeous building overlooks the Los Angeles Basin, providing amazing views across Hollywood and beyond. But that's nothing compared to the peek at the night sky you'll get inside via the telescopes. Entry to the grounds and building is free, as is a look through the telescopes, but individual exhibitions cost a few dollars each.</p>\n<h2>13. Check your reflection at Millennium Park in Chicago</h2>\n<p>Millennium Park is Chicago's best loved outdoor space, packed with a winning mix of glorious green gardens and stunning modern art. But it's probably most famous for the futuristic Cloud Gate sculpture, more commonly known as \"The Bean.\" The park has a full program of free events, so check the schedule ahead of time to see if there's anything else going on while you're there.</p>\n<h2>14. Take the Samuel Adams Brewery Tour in Boston</h2>\n<p>The Samuel Adams Brewery tour is completely free of charge (though suggested donations of $2 that go to local charities are welcomed). Find out the inner workings of one of America's best breweries and you can even taste three beers for free. Tours run every half-hour so show up and wait in line.</p>\n<h2>15. Walk the Freedom Trail in Boston</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Freedom Trail is a 2.5-mile, red brick path through the heart of Boston that can be completed over the course of a couple hours. Starting at the Boston Common, you'll take in many of the city's most important historical sites, from the site of the Boston Massacre, to the Old South Meeting House where the Boston Tea Party took place. (See also: <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/4-affordable-autumn-destinations-for-nature-lovers?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Affordable Autumn Destinations for Nature Lovers</a>)</p>\n<h2>16. Set sail on the Sam Houston Boat Tour in Houston</h2>\n<p>Take a 90-minute boat trip around Houston's working port, where you'll learn about the history of the area, and its current maritime industry. While the tour is free and passengers even get a complimentary drink, you must register for a spot online beforehand, as no walk-ons are permitted.</p>\n<h2>17.

The price of setting up tent in an established campsite can add up quickly and turn a budget getaway into a bank breaker.</p>\n<p>Modern campsites can also feel a little too rigid — laid out like parking lots with minimal space between tents and crammed with <a href=\"https://www.wisebread.com/the-easiest-ways-to-save-on-your-next-rv-camping-trip?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">fancy RVs</a>. Having fantastic amenities like bathrooms, picnic areas, electricity hookups, and even Wi-Fi is great for some, but for other people it can almost negate the simple pleasures of escaping into the wilderness.</p>\n<p>If you're after a more rugged adventure, then rest assured, it's entirely possible to find sweet spots to lay your head at night with absolutely no costs attached.

No bathrooms, no electricity, no running water, and no picnic tables. You will literally pick a spot in the great outdoors where you can pitch your tent without charge.</p>\n<p>Many dispersed camping sites are in extremely remote locations, so don't count on being able to a get phone signal or mobile internet access. Because of this, you should always plan ahead by downloading a map of the area, or even carrying a paper one.</p>\n<p>No matter where you camp, you should always follow the seven <a href=\"https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles\" target=\"_blank\">Leave No Trace</a> principles and adopt the <a href=\"https://www.treadlightly.org/recreation_tips/camping/\" target=\"_blank\">Tread Lightly policy</a>.

Ordinarily you can camp in these areas for up to 14 days, although this does vary from site to site, and in some places you'll need to secure a permit beforehand.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to find a BLM campsite is to search for the state or location you're interested in on their Visit page. Once you find a suitable location, the information page will display camping details of the area.

You can also filter them according to amenities, the kind of access they have, and the activities you can do in or around them.</p>\n<p>Park rangers are also a great source of information on free camping sites, so if you're visiting a National Park and come across one, ask them to share a bit of insider knowledge.

But not all domestic damage is his or her responsibility. What exactly are you on the hook for? Find out which home repairs are not your landlord's problem — and start saving up for them now.</p>\n<h2>1. Replacing light bulbs, batteries, and HVAC filters</h2>\n<p>The landlord can't control how much you run the lights, so replacing bulbs when they burn out is your responsibility. The same may be true for replacing batteries where necessary, including those in smoke and CO2 detectors, which should be outlined in your lease so that there's no confusion about who's supposed to keep up with home safety. Many leases will also require tenants to replace air filters in HVAC systems on a regular basis (ideally every three months, but landlords often supply the filters).</p>\n<h2>2. Unclogging backed-up drains that you caused</h2>\n<p>Here's what I've learned from personal experience: Don't put eggshells or potato skins in the garbage disposal if you don't know how to unclog the sink. Otherwise, it'll cost you a visit from the plumber, because this is definitely not your landlord's problem. Same goes for the toilet — you do the crime, you do the time. Unclog it yourself or call someone ASAP before the problem turns into more damage from overflowing water and other \"stuff.\"</p>\n<p>Practice other considerate grooming habits, too — like cleaning your hair out of drains to keep pipes in working order. If your landlord has to come over to do this for you, he or she has every right to tack an extra fee onto your rent that month.</p>\n<h2>3. Certain pest infestations</h2>\n<p>Assuming that you're moving into a rental unit that doesn't have any existing vermin problems (you should verify this independently before signing a lease; don't just take the landlord's word for it), you may be responsible for any rodent or bug infestations that occur after you move in. Be sure to check the terms of your lease as well as any state-specific laws regarding pests such as bedbugs.</p>\n<p>Certain living habits, like leaving old food out or failing to regularly take out the trash, can attract ants, cockroaches, or even rats. If your landlord finds you responsible for the infestation, you will likely have to pay up to get rid of the problem.</p>\n<p>Other bug or rodent infestations can happen naturally. Termites, for example, can infest any building regardless of your living habits. In this case, it's on the landlord to get an exterminator. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-cheap-ways-to-get-rid-of-household-pests?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Cheap Ways to Get Rid of Household Pests</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Lawn care and snow shoveling at single-family homes</h2>\n<p>Unless your landlord has agreed to handle the mowing and snow shoveling in the single-family home you're renting, you'll need to get out there yourself. While you can let the lawn go for a little while, you're legally required to have your sidewalk shoveled within a few hours after a snowstorm ceases. Fail to do it and you could face fines from the city, which also will be your responsibility. If you live in a multiunit dwelling, however, the landlord generally takes on this responsibility him or herself or hires someone to do it.</p>\n<h2>5. Damage to property due to your negligence</h2>\n<p>Being a decent human being means taking responsibility for damage caused by your own negligence — accidental or not — and that of your family, friends, kids, and other guests you invite into the home. Your landlord is not responsible for anyone's carelessness; you can't punch holes in the walls during an argument and expect them to fix it. And please, don't lie to get out of whatever it is you or they did to damage the property. Be an adult, pay for the repairs, and move on (ideally with people who don't destroy things).</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. Carpet cleaning and repainting</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest costs to landlords is replacing carpet ruined over time by tenants. I've seen some of this damage myself, and I'm frankly baffled by how disrespectful some people are and the lengths they'll go to try to skirt the cost of cleaning or replacing the carpet.</p>\n<p>Repainting the walls their original color (if you've painted them) is also your responsibility. This should absolutely be a clause in your lease, but you should always contact your landlord before making any paint decisions. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-smart-ways-to-get-your-apartment-deposit-back?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Smart Ways to Get Your Apartment Deposit Back</a>)</p>\n<h2>7. Pet damage</h2>\n<p>I once had a tenant who was not authorized to bring an animal into my shore rental, but did so anyway. When I questioned her about it, she denied it. I explained to her the strong smell of feline urine upstairs, at which point she revised her story to having a dog in the house briefly. I wasn't born yesterday, lady. The dog bit was a lie, too — but it didn't matter what kind of pet was in my house. It was unauthorized, and I passed the cleaning bill right along to her.</p>\n<h2>8. Misuse of appliances that cause them to malfunction</h2>\n<p>You break it, you buy it — that's the rule with appliances in your rental that you've damaged. Whether you've caused a dryer fire from neglecting to clean out the lint trap, burned out motors from working appliances too hard, or caused the dishwasher to overflow because you thought laundry detergent would work in lieu of dishwashing liquid (shout-out to my ex-husband), it's all your responsibility. If any appliance just stops working, however, it's probably on your landlord — so give 'em a call.</p>\n<h2>9. Holes in the wall from frames and shelving that you hung</h2>\n<p>Before you can get your security deposit back, your landlord will want to make sure a few tasks are completed, including patching up holes you've put in the wall from frames, shelves, and other damage you may have caused to the drywall and paint from adhesives. Skip out on it and you can kiss your money goodbye.</p>\n<h2>10. Anything else outlined in the lease</h2>\n<p>Read your lease closely before signing. Most issues of landlord/tenant responsibility are outlined in the document. Keep it on hand to go over again if issues arise so you can quickly determine whether or not the burden and financial responsibility falls on you. Once your signature is on the lease, you're legally bound to it. If you feel like something outlined should be the landlord's responsibility, discuss it beforehand to revise if necessary. After that there's no wiggle room — it's either your problem, or not.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

What are the traits that make for a great investor?</p>\n<h2>Compassion</h2>\n<p>Hollywood is awash with stories of money men who live by this mantra: \"Greed is good.\" The Gordon Gekko character is burned into our collective memories for life. From <em>The Boiler Room</em> to <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>, we get it — the industry is full of sharks.</p>\n<p>It turns out, sharkiness may work against you in the world of finance.</p>\n<p>A study published by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology looked at the behavior of hedge fund managers over a decade. Managers with psychopathic, narcissistic, or Machiavellian personalities underperformed their peers by 1 percent annually. Over time, their ruthless approach to decision making added up to notable losses.</p>\n<p>By avoiding aggressive instincts and underhanded tendencies, we can focus on developing the positive, compassionate traits that have helped billionaire investors like Warren Buffett and George Soros achieve amazing results. This means leaving the shady, cunning type of investor to Hollywood.

That mentality can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Make no mistake; if you never take the plunge into investing, you're guaranteed to never see any returns.</p>\n<p>Believing that you have the ability to be successful at investing and building wealth is the frame of mind you should always strive for. Whether you endeavor to develop the skills and DIY your approach to investing, or seek the services of a qualified money manager, believing in your ability to make sound financial decisions will help you move forward.</p>\n<p>Optimism can be hard to sustain, but immersing yourself in a world of productive investment information has never been easier. Connect with groups through Facebook, browse personal finance websites, and follow the advice of investors with a track record of long-term success. Seeing your glass as half-full is great for the bottom line. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-confidence-inspiring-facts-about-the-stock-market?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Confidence-Inspiring Facts About the Stock Market</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Patience</h2>\n<p>Successful billionaires like Warren Buffett take a long-term approach to investing. \"Our favorite holding period is forever,\" he's quoted as saying. Patience will help you avoid reacting rashly to groupthink surrounding market fluctuations or hyperbolic headlines predicting the end of life as we know it. You may have done some research and found that the stock market's average annual return is 7 percent when you look at any 10-year period. This information feeds your optimism, and therefore you're willing to be patient. And your patience will help you keep a long-term perspective.</p>\n<h2>Goal-orientation</h2>\n<p>Since investing success requires a long-term perspective, goal-oriented people tend to have a leg up in this arena. Staying focused on the end goal helps you avoid distractions. Deciding whether you're investing for retirement, to purchase a house, or to save for a child's college fund will determine your best course of action. Setting interim goals, like completing an investing for beginners class or interviewing three financial planners, keeps goal-oriented people on the path to desired results.</p>\n<h2>Levelheadedness</h2>\n<p>Do you keep a cool head when everyone around you is in meltdown mode? Do you immediately default to the next steps required in the midst of a crisis? Your levelheaded temperament may easily be the most important personality predictor of success with investing, not your intellect. That is according to Mr. Warren Buffett.</p>\n<p>Panic in the markets can be contagious; especially when our hard-earned cash is at stake. Your ability to remain calm in the face of short-term fluctuations will lead to better decisions and opportunities that investors who follow the crowd may overlook.

Inheriting millions from a wealthy, great-uncle you never knew existed. Pitching the perfect business idea to the perfect person at just the right time.</p>\n<p>But chasing quick riches and instant wealth is an exercise in futility. It's like trying to capture a purple unicorn that lives outside of the castle just beyond the end of the rainbow; it's impossible. It doesn't exist. Movies, books, and social media have sold the idea that getting rich quick is possible. But that is a lie.</p>\n<p>The allure of fast, easy money is a mirage that can lure you down a dark path. You risk emotional and financial devastation, as well as wasted energy and resources. And yet, people can't seem to let go of searching for ways to skip work and go straight to the wealth. It is impossible — always has been, and always will be. Here's why.</p>\n<h2>1. The law of equity (what you put in is what you get out)</h2>\n<p>The human mind, body, and soul is built for efficiency. Think about what happens when you decide to start exercising. At first, your movements are awkward. You lack coordination and you wear yourself out quickly. But a funny thing happens over time — you adapt. You not only get better at performing the exercises, but your body also adjusts and finds ways to perform the movements more efficiently in order to conserve energy.</p>\n<p>The same thing is true when it comes to building wealth. It is natural to look for ways to get as far as you can with as little effort as possible, but there will always be a limit. Working out physically allows your body to adapt by building muscle memory, strength, and endurance. Similarly, as you build wealth, you develop patience, mental strength, and the stamina you need to sustain your money over time. And just like with exercise, getting rich is generally an equitable endeavor — at least initially. You only get out what you put in.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is obtaining wealth — or anything of value — is usually attached to hard work, patience, and growth over time. Wealth without work is similar to using crash diets to lose weight. The results are not sustainable and you haven't learned how to properly maintain the changes. You need to consistently work hard and see your progress increase over time.</p>\n<h2>2. Easy come easy go</h2>\n<p>There are countless stories of people who come into a tremendous amount of money only to find themselves back where they started shortly thereafter. According to the National Endowment for Financial Education, 70 percent of people who win the lottery or get a big windfall all at once go broke within a few years.</p>\n<p>Getting money and keeping it are two entirely different things. When you get something quick — without having to work and sweat for it — you don't value it as much. And what you don't value, you won't protect. One of the biggest problems financial advisers deal with when people get a sudden windfall is that they give too much away to family and friends. And they fail to properly keep track of what they get. When you get money quickly but haven't learned how to properly manage the little you had before, you simply repeat the same cycles but on a much larger scale.</p>\n<p>When you aren't used to having, tracking, and managing large sums of money, it's really easy for you to lose it. There are people out there waiting for an opportunity to separate someone like you from your cash. Just like you want a quick buck, so does everyone else. And while your value system may only allow you to go so far to get it, others are far less scrupulous.

Don't Make These 6 Dumb Mistakes With Your Financial Windfall</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. A fool and their money are easily parted</h2>\n<p>Get rich quick schemes are never advertised as such. They are shrouded in mystery and secrecy. And who doesn't love a good secret? Especially one that can make you rich and elevate you above the rest of us mere mortals?</p>\n<p>Most get rich quick schemes play on your desire for lopsided outcomes. Again, looking for a way to maximize impact and to gain ground quickly is completely natural and strategic. It doesn't make you a bad person. But it can make you a target.</p>\n<p>The best approach to take when it comes to investment pitches and business propositions is to keep it simple. You are not a financial expert nor a business mogul. Don't pretend to be one. If you don't know, you don't know. Not knowing or understanding an investment or proposal is a key indicator that you need to back away from the table.</p>\n<p>If it seems to good to be true, it is. If it sounds a little off, run. If it skirts the lines of legality, skip it. You have an internal gut feeling that causes you to pause; pay attention to that feeling. Don't let greed and/or arrogance push you into falling for fool's gold. Scam artists do what they do for a living. It's not a game for them. Humbly admitting that you don't understand the venture and gracefully bowing out can save not only money, but time and headaches as well.

It requires wisdom to build wealth (wisdom takes time)</h2>\n<p>Luck has very little to do with becoming wealthy. The ability to recognize and capitalize on a good opportunity is not happenstance. It takes wisdom to build and keep wealth. And building wealth slowly and experiencing the highs and lows of money management is what helps you gain wisdom.</p>\n<p>You have to be diligent in order to truly be rich. You have to read, study, ask questions, and be willing to learn from others who are where you want to be. Being able to sniff out a con and spot a diamond among rocks takes keen senses, experience, and time.

Wealth is not a destination</h2>\n<p>One of the top reasons that getting rich quick isn't possible is because the concept itself is misguided. What is rich? When is enough, <em>enough</em>? And how do you know you are actually rich? Are you \"oficially\" rich when you reach millionaire status? Are you rich when you can buy whatever your heart desires? There are famous athletes, actors and actresses, singers, doctors, lawyers, scientist, etc. that make hundreds of thousands of dollars — millions even — but still are broke.</p>\n<p>Wealth is a journey, not a destination. It is more than money in the bank and possessing expensive trinkets. You will gain money and you will spend it. You will earn it and lose it. Being rich is when you arrive at a place where you are able to be content with and manage what you have — no matter how much or how little. Being rich is a state of mind and a place of peace that is not greedy and constantly reaching for more. It's a journey of contentment. And that journey doesn't happen overnight.

This wildly successful video platform has revolutionized the way people consume media, and has provided people who have no previous media connections the opportunity to make money by creating and uploading their own content.</p>\n<p>Sure, you’ve probably heard of YouTube megastars who have vast numbers of subscribers and are making millions of dollars each year through their channels. But did you know that there are also people out there who aren’t well-known, but are still making a solid living via YouTube? (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-social-media-stars-who-earn-way-more-than-you?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Social Media Stars Who Earn Way More Than You</a>)</p>\n<p>Though it’s unlikely you’ll make it into the upper echelons of YouTube superstardom, it’s good to have an idea of just how lucrative this platform can be. In 2016, YouTube’s top 10 earners all made over $5 million. The top earner, controversial Swedish online gamer and prankster, PewDiePie, single-handedly raked in over $15 million. Here’s how you, too, can earn money by creating YouTube videos.</p>\n<h2>1. Choose a niche</h2>\n<p>This is possibly the single most important step to making money from YouTube videos because it’s going to determine your audience. It will have a huge bearing on your earnings as it’s your audience who will ultimately attract paying advertisers. It’s essential that you pick a niche that’s narrow enough for you to be able to make an impact in. A small niche is easier to target and monetize, and they’re more likely to be engaged. Yet, you want a niche that’s popular enough that lots of people search for it.</p>\n<p>The best place to start when you’re trying to find your niche is with your own interests and pastimes. If you’re not passionate about the subject you choose, then you’ll soon lose interest and it will come across to your audience in your videos. Choosing something that you’re knowledgeable about and have a real interest in will make creating videos far easier and more enjoyable for you.</p>\n<p>Popular niches that some of the most successful YouTubers are active in include gaming, comedy, beauty and fashion, pets and animals, and music. Keep in mind that it’s possible to pick a niche within a niche — so, rather than starting a general fitness channel, you could make videos on weight loss through running for beginners. It’s still about running, but your audience is far more targeted within that subject. The more well-defined your niche, the better.

Create great content</h2>\n<p>Initially, setting up your channel is a simple process of providing your personal details and deciding your channel name. From here, it’s time to get the camera out and start making great content, because the ultimate aim is to get the most views possible. You’ve probably heard the phrase “content is king,” and nowhere is that more relevant than on YouTube. The only way to get lots of eyes on your videos is to make them informative, engaging, and on subjects that people will find interesting.</p>\n<h2>3. Grow your audience</h2>\n<p>Once you have created a few videos, you should start trying to grow your audience. Though this will happen organically if your videos are on searchable subjects, there are some easy ways to give it a kick-start. Try doing a shoutout on social media to tap into your existing contacts there, asking them to check out your channel. Also, ask people to subscribe to your channel in your videos. The more subscribers you have, the more likely they are to return and watch more.</p>\n<p>Another great way to grow your channel is to be consistent and post your videos at regular intervals. This will teach your audience to know when to expect your latest video, and potentially even encourage them to look forward to and follow it like a regular TV show. Check out more ideas for growing your audience on YouTube’s Creator Academy.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Monetize your channel</h2>\n<p>There are two main forms of advertising that will allow you to make money directly from YouTube’s platform. These are display ads along the bottom of the video, and the video ads that play at the beginning of a video and can be skipped by clicking “Skip Video” after a few seconds. To be able to have your videos display these, you’ll need to apply to the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Partner Program</a>. For your application to be reviewed, your channel needs to have already had 10,000 public channel views, so it may be a while before you can actually apply. And if you don't get approved, you can reapply after 30 days.</p>\n<p>To access your payments once they start coming in, you’ll need to have an AdSense account. AdSense is Google’s advertising program across its whole network of content sites. If you already have an AdSense account, you can use that. The AdSense account is where all of your payments will be processed, so it’s an absolute necessity.</p>\n<p>Next, you need to set your monetization preferences by selecting the type of ads you want shown, and on which videos they should appear. To maximize your earnings, it’s best to set them to be shown on all videos that have already been uploaded, plus future videos you upload. Alternatively, you can choose videos individually on which to display ads.</p>\n<p>The amount that people make through YouTube varies greatly. It all depends on your audience and value of ads shown on your videos. Luckily, <a href=\"https://socialblade.com/youtube/youtube-money-calculator\" target=\"_blank\">Social Blade has a useful tool</a> to help you estimate what you may be able to earn from your own channel.

Expand your reach</h2>\n<p>Ads are not the only way of making money on YouTube. There are also indirect ways to make money from your videos. Once you have an established audience and a high number of views for your content, lots of other doors may open up. Brands love to work with popular YouTube creators to help show off their products in sponsored campaigns, and if you’ve chosen your niche well, you don’t necessarily need millions of subscribers. Companies are eager to speak directly to their target audience.

YouTube makes it possible for you to link directly to external sites in your videos, so viewers can easily purchase the products you promote.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Have you ever feared that you would be \"found out\" to be less competent than others think you are? The \"<a href=\"http://www.paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">impostor phenomenon</a>\" was first described in 1978 in a study about professional women who believed that they had achieved their success by luck or by mistake, instead of by their intelligence and competence.</p>\n<p>Since then, researchers have learned that what we now call \"impostor syndrome\" affects not only women, but also men in roughly equal numbers. Described as an inability to internalize one's own successes, the self-doubt of feeling like an impostor can hold you back when you consistently underestimate yourself or sell yourself short. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-ways-even-shy-people-can-fake-confidence-and-get-ahead?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Ways Even Shy People Can Fake Confidence and Get Ahead</a>)</p>\n<p>The good news is, research shows that impostor syndrome isn't really a syndrome — it's not a personality trait, nor a mental disorder, nor is it rare. In fact, almost everyone experiences it as a reaction to a situation at some point. With that in mind, there are some strategies you can use to combat feelings of inadequacy and to feel confident in your own abilities.</p>\n<h2>1. Remember that you're not alone</h2>\n<p>Some of the most successful people in history have described feelings of disbelief in their success. From Maya Angelou to Albert Einstein, many famous achievers felt that they did not deserve the accolades and success they had achieved.</p>\n<p>So if you have similar fears of being found out, know that you're in good company! Most likely, everyone in the room has had similar feelings and insecurities. It kind of makes you feel better about your own feelings of inadequacy if you know that the person you're talking to most likely feels them too, doesn't it? We're all just faking it till we make it.</p>\n<h2>2. Talk about it</h2>\n<p>When you feel that you don't have what it takes to succeed, it can help to talk with a trusted friend or mentor who can give a more objective perspective on the situation. A supportive friend who knows your abilities and successes can encourage you, can point to reasons why you shouldn't feel nervous about your abilities, and can help you think through the situation. Even if they are simply repeating things you already know (\"You've already done a project like this, and you can do this one, too\"), it can help to hear it come out of someone else's mouth.</p>\n<h2>3. Focus on the work</h2>\n<p>Instead of dwelling on what your work says about you, focus on finding solutions to the problem at hand. You have less time for self-doubt if you're thinking about the work itself. I often find that while I might dread a task because I'm afraid I'm not qualified enough to do it, once I get started, that fear often goes away because I'm too busy to think about it. (<a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/dont-panic-how-to-meet-a-deadline?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Don't Panic! How to Meet a Deadline</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. It's not bad to be an outsider</h2>\n<p>You may feel like the least qualified person in the room, but that doesn't mean you don't have something to contribute. Often, people with an outsider perspective are able to see solutions that seasoned experts miss because they're too close to the subject. Outsiders are often able to reframe the problem to see from a different perspective. So even if you have less expertise, think of your outsider status as an asset, not a liability.</p>\n<h2>5. Avoid undermining yourself</h2>\n<p>Try to stop yourself from using phrases like, \"Well, I'm no expert, but I think …\" or \"I don't really know what I'm talking about, but …\" While such refreshing humility can be appealing on a personal level, they can undermine you on a professional level. Don't make others doubt your opinion before you even give it. There's a difference between acknowledging that you don't have all the answers, and tearing yourself down.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. Focus on what you can learn</h2>\n<p>Instead of thinking about how you're performing and how that performance looks to others, think instead of what you can learn from the experience. If your pitch for a new project ends up being rejected, focus on what you can learn to be successful next time. Treating each situation like an experiment makes it less personal. Failure simply means that the approach needs to be slightly different next time, instead of confirming your worst fears about yourself.

Your worth isn't in your achievement</h2>\n<p>Many people who experience impostor syndrome associate achievement with self-worth. Surround yourself with friends and mentors who value you not for what you achieve, but for who you are as a friend and as a person. And realize that no matter how much you achieve, success alone will not make people genuinely love you or care for you.</p>\n<h2>8. Realize perfection is not attainable</h2>\n<p>Many people who struggle with impostor syndrome also tend to be perfectionists who cannot let a task go until they have overplanned and overworked it to the point of exhaustion. Or, that perfectionism might manifest itself as a fear of trying a new task because you might not be able to do it perfectly. Either way, overcoming impostor syndrome involves being able to do a task well enough, instead of perfectly. Cut yourself off when you find yourself obsessing over making something perfect. In my experience, the more you fuss over it, the less creative and fresh the final result will be.</p>\n<h2>9. Keep in mind that it's not always about you</h2>\n<p>Over the last few years, I've learned that sometimes, a less than optimal result has more to do with factors out of your control than with your own abilities. Perhaps a client's timetable had to be more rushed than optimal, or budget constraints did not allow you to operate at full potential. While it's important to be realistic about how you can improve, all you can control is how you act, respond, and learn from the experience. You can't change all those other factors — you're just one person. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/12-ways-you-can-go-easier-on-yourself?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">12 Ways You Can Go Easier on Yourself</a>)</p>\n<h2>10. Don't forget that impostor syndrome can be a strength</h2>\n<p>If you don't allow impostor syndrome to cripple you from taking risks, it can actually bring about some positive effects. Acknowledging that you don't have all the answers can create an atmosphere of trust, communicativeness, and teamwork.</p>\n<p>Case in point — I recently went to a media event, and a blogger at my table openly admitted, right at the beginning of the event, that she had been nervous about coming because of her so-called social awkwardness. You could almost hear the collective sigh of relief going around the table — we were not alone!</p>\n<p>Impostor syndrome means that you know you have a lot to learn, which can push you to be more innovative, more team-oriented, and more hardworking. So next time impostor syndrome whispers in your ear, treat it like the friend (or frenemy?) who keeps you on your toes, but sometimes needs to be put in its place.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Being able to sustain your independence with both your money and lifestyle is a skill that everyone needs to learn, and every parent needs to start teaching while their kids are still young.</p>\n<p>The good news is, this is very doable. If you're currently trying to mold impressionable youngsters into self-sufficient adults, here's how you can protect them from a very rude awakening when they go it alone.</p>\n<h2>1. Teach them basic life skills</h2>\n<p>I'm fortunate to have grown up in a family of blue-collar Americans who relied on their own wits and two bare hands to get by, and they were eager to pass their skills down to their children and grandchildren. Some of those skills took (I make a mean Bundt cake and clean the house with maid-like results), while others are still a work in progress (I call AAA when I have a flat tire; might as well get my money's worth, right?).</p>\n<p>These basic life skills should be required teaching at home because your kids won't learn them any place else. I'm a huge advocate for integrating this sort of education into the public school curriculum — because honestly, what teenager needs to know calculus over income tax prep? — but as it stands, that responsibility falls to you. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-life-skills-your-kids-wont-learn-in-school?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Life Skills Your Kids Won't Learn in School</a>)</p>\n<p>As such, it's on you to school your offspring on all of life's dirty little jobs, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Laundry and other household chores.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Grocery shopping, meal prep, and cooking for themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrating coupons and discounts into their everyday purchases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How credit and debit cards work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How interest rates affect loans.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The difference between paying in cash versus relying on credit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to prepare a resume.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to interview for a job (and not look like a slob).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to comprehend basic contracts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to drive or use public transportation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to make and stick to a budget.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Manage their money for their first year of employment</h2>\n<p>Adults spend their money on frivolous things a lot of the time — so what do you expect kids to do? As soon as they get a job and start bringing home the bacon, they're rushing straight to their favorite stores for new clothes, taking their boyfriend or girlfriend out on a nice date, and loading up on drive-thru junk food.</p>\n<p>We all did it.</p>\n<p>You can curb that behavior by sitting your kid down and letting them know that the Bank of Mom and/or Dad will be in charge of their income for the first year of their first job. Offering them this kind of hands-on guidance and advice is a good way to teach teens how to save and spend wisely.</p>\n<p>Open two accounts in their name — checking and savings — and put 40 percent of their paycheck into each of those accounts. Give them the leftover 20 percent to do whatever they'd like. When expenses arise for which you don't feel responsible, like if they receive a speeding ticket or want to go away for the weekend with friends, explain how the money will come from <em>their</em> checking account to pay for it. You may get some resistance at first, especially if they're used to you forking cash over, but they'll thank their lucky stars they know how to manage money when they strike out on their own.</p>\n<h2>3. Charge them rent to live in your home once they turn 18</h2>\n<p>Your kids are adults the day they turn 18 — a fact that your teenager has probably reminded you of a million times since they started high school — and it's high time you started treating them accordingly. If they want to be grown-ups with no rules and no curfew but still live under your roof, you have every right to ask for help with the bills.</p>\n<p>You don't have to charge them fair market value, but a couple hundred bucks a month, or even putting them in charge of a particular bill, is reasonable. I'm also a proponent of teens paying their own cellphone bill starting at age 18. They'll certainly learn to be more responsible with their phones when repairs or replacements are coming out of their own pockets.</p>\n<h2>4. Help them establish good credit and explain the importance of it</h2>\n<p>I didn't know anything about how credit worked before I got my first credit card. Given that naivetÃ©, I went on a shopping spree as soon as the card was in my hands, and I didn't/couldn't pay the bill until seven years later. That's what can happen when a clueless 18-year-old gets their hands on a shiny piece of plastic. And in my case, it royally screwed up my credit for a long time.</p>\n<p>Help your kids avoid my mistake by talking to them about how credit works and the importance of being conscious about building and maintaining a good credit score. Educate them on how good credit affects major purchases like cars and houses and even renting apartments. Their livelihood depends on it — unless, of course, you want them to live with you forever.

Provide less for them once they start driving</h2>\n<p>As your child's parent or guardian, it's your legal responsibility to provide for them until they're able to provide for themselves. But you can start to cut back on the handouts as soon as they're responsible enough to drive.</p>\n<p>Certainly you still need to feed, clothe, and provide housing for your child, but they can start doing more for themselves, too. They can run to the store for their own hair product when they run out, open their own wallets for the video games they covet, and even make their own dentist and doctor appointments. Think of it as an education in independence with training wheels. You're still around to guide them through the processes, but they should start accepting tasks as their own.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. Teach them time management skills</h2>\n<p>My friends make fun of me for how much I micromanage my own time. Anything I have to do goes straight into my calendar, and I keep a daily to-do list at work while creating side lists on an as-needed basis. As a result, my life runs much smoother.</p>\n<p>Considering your kids — especially high-schoolers — have busy schedules (for which they likely rely on you to keep on track), it will eventually benefit them for you to teach good time-management skills. Teach them how to add to-dos to their smartphone calendars as soon as they receive them, set up alerts for reminders, and help them form a habit of checking their schedule on a daily basis to keep their lives running smoothly.</p>\n<h2>7. Step back when they have a problem until your help is absolutely required</h2>\n<p>A large part of maturing to adulthood is learning how to solve problems on your own, and that means you need to let your children make mistakes from time to time — even when they come to you looking for the easy way out.</p>\n<p>\"There is a tendency for parents to step in too quickly when their children face a problem,\" says Jim Seibold, a marriage and family therapist in Arlington, Texas. \"Instead of telling them what to do and how they need to fix it, push them to think through options. Ask them what they think they should do. We can then teach by asking them to think about the consequences of their ideas. For instance: 'That sounds interesting, what do you think would happen if you tried that?'\"</p>\n<p>Just as importantly, this approach expresses confidence in your kids. It lets them know that you believe in their ability to think and consider choices, which will be helpful when it's time for them to move out of the house. That alone can be worth its weight in gold for worrisome moms and dads.

Stop giving them everything they want or think they need</h2>\n<p>I wasn't deprived of anything growing up, but I wasn't handed everything I wanted, either. Around age 14, my parents encouraged me to start working part time for the money I needed to go out with my friends or buy the things that teenagers want to buy. I wasn't over the moon about it at the time, but I also didn't hate it — I made new friends, had a sense of freedom, and did what I pleased with my money. In hindsight, it helped lay the foundation of my entrepreneurial spirit, which has gotten me everywhere I've wanted to be in life thus far.</p>\n<p>Seibold instituted a similar practice in his family, asking his kids to purchase their own electronics, cellphones, and any other luxury they wanted.</p>\n<p>\"They learned to save money they received for birthdays, Christmas, etc., so they could afford these purchases,\" he explains. \"As parents, we still pay for a lot, but it is important for kids to understand what it means to put off immediate gratification in order to save for something they really want. It may have been 'easy' money since it was gifted, but they still had to learn to save.\"</p>\n<h2>9. Establish good nutritional habits from the get-go</h2>\n<p>Most of us enjoy junk food every now and then (sometimes a little more often than that — guilty!), but nutrition and cooking skills all begin with you as a parent. It's your job to raise your children on healthy meals and teach them how to make smart food choices so they're eating a balanced diet. Does that mean you should never order pizza or pull into a drive-thru? No, of course not. But you should be conscious of limiting those instances to help your child establish a healthy relationship with food so they're best prepared to feed themselves responsibly (and cook instead of relying on takeout).</p>\n<h2>10. Praise your children, but don't go overboard</h2>\n<p>Encourage your children to express themselves, to try their best at whatever they attempt, and to accept failures gracefully. The truth is, somebody has to be the loser; that's just how life goes. The quicker they learn that they can't always come out on top, the easier life will be. They need both the confidence to reach for their aspirations and the grit to learn and move forward if things don't go their way.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Money conversations can be stressful and awkward, and you may be tempted to just stay mum on the subject. However, it's vital that you pass financial wisdom on to your kids, even when they're adults. It's important to teach them about money growing up, but there are some things better discussed when they are older. Here are the money conversations you should be having with your adult children.</p>\n<h2>1. Financial boundaries</h2>\n<p>If you are supporting your adult children and you'd like to stop, or if you want to avoid it altogether, it's important to set up some financial boundaries. If you don't want to support them financially at all, tell them that up front and stick to it. That way, you won't end up paying for things and resenting it.</p>\n<p>If your adult kids are relying on you for part or all of their financial support, sit down together and form a plan. Cutting them off entirely probably won't work for either of you, but you can start slow; back off on payments over the course of six months to a year, and set up concrete steps along the way. For instance, you may decide to stop giving them \"fun\" money right away, but be willing to cover their cellphone plan for six more months.</p>\n<p>Make sure you go about having this conversation compassionately. Tell your child that you love them and that you want this for them as well as for you. Offer to help them along the way, to be available to answer questions or aid in budgeting, and let them know that you will always be there for them in other ways.

Financial values</h2>\n<p>Have a conversation with your adult child about what they want in life and how much those things will realistically cost. This is the time to talk about the financials behind car ownership, homeownership, traveling the world, and more. Make sure they have an understanding of how much money they'll need to have in order to afford the lifestyle they want, and how much they need to make in a week, a month, and a year to achieve that.</p>\n<p>Talk to them, also, about what is really important in life. Tell them that fancy cars, big houses, and lavish vacations aren't the keys to happiness. Ask them to think about what they would pursue if they were dying or what they would miss most if they suffered a serious injury. This can help them figure out what is important to them and what they may not be willing to trade their time and money for.</p>\n<h2>3. What it means to live within your means</h2>\n<p>Your adult kids need to understand the importance of spending less than they earn. Show them how to calculate this so they can determine for themselves when to spend their money and when it would be better to save or invest it. Your kids need to figure out how to sacrifice spending on superfluous things in order to live a financially secure life.</p>\n<h2>4. How to make a budget</h2>\n<p>Along the same lines, your adult children need to know how to make a budget. You can actually begin teaching this in childhood by giving your kid a weekly allowance and helping them break down how they want to spend their money. Even if you wait until they're older, though, you need to sit down with them and make sure your kids understand what they <em>need</em> to spend money on, what they <em>want</em> to spend money on, and how to allocate those dollars accordingly.

The benefits and dangers of loans and credit cards</h2>\n<p>In a culture where credit is readily available, your kids need to know how to evaluate different credit opportunities based on benefits and drawbacks, as well as how to wisely use credit. As soon as they are old enough to obtain financing of their own, you need to talk with your kids about credit cards, educational loans, personal loans, and home loans.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>It will help to tell stories from your own life. Whether you've made financial mistakes or have been wise with your money, walking your kids through how you made your financial decisions and how they ultimately affected you will make the principles real, rather than keep them so abstract.

Saving for retirement</h2>\n<p>It can be hard for people in their late teens and 20s to think about saving for retirement, because it all feels so far away. But it's critical you talk with your adult children about how much they may need for retirement, and walk through some compound interest calculations with them so they see the benefit of saving early. Make sure they understand the basics of an IRA and 401(k), as well as what it means to be fully vested and take advantage of an employer match.

Your financial plan</h2>\n<p>As your kids get older, they also need to know about <em>your</em> financial plan, before they find themselves trying to figure it out without you. This can be an especially difficult conversation to have, because on top of talking about money, you're also talking about serious injury, illness, or death.</p>\n<p>Still, it's important for your kids to know what types of insurance you have, because knowing whether you have long-term care coverage, for instance, may help them make better decisions later on. Talk to them, too, about how you plan to divide up your estate. This can keep conflicts to a minimum after you are gone, so they can grieve instead of fight.

They should have access to the location of your accounts, the account numbers, and any identification information, as well as contact information for your lawyer. You can write all of this out for them so they can simply file it away until they need it.</p>\n<p>Talking about money can be hard, but it's also important. Speaking with your adult children about these topics will ensure they have a better chance at a financially healthy life.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?
