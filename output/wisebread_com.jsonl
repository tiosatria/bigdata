Of course you're going to pick up. What if it's the school nurse calling about your children? What if it's your dentist's office calling to reschedule an appointment?</p>\n<p>Then you pick up and a recording tells you that you've won a free cruise to Alaska or that you owe money to the IRS.</p>\n<p>Yes, you've been hit by a robocall. These obnoxious recorded messages are used by companies to persuade you to buy something you usually don't need. Not only are they annoying, but robocalls can be dangerous, too. Plenty of scammers use them to trick people into giving up their Social Security numbers, credit card digits, or other personal information. Worst of all? These robocalls are increasing, and so are complaints from consumers who have been harassed by those prerecorded pitches and scams.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are steps you can take to stop at least a chunk of these calls and to protect yourself from any automated scams targeting your phone number.</p>\n<h2>We're answering a LOT more robocalls lately</h2>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission reported that in 2017, consumers filed more than 4.5 million complaints with the commission about robocalls. That ranks as the highest number of complaints in any year, and is a sharp increase from the more than 3.4 million robocall complaints consumers filed with the FTC in 2016.</p>\n<p>The most common topic of these robocalls is debt reduction. Robocalls about vacations and timeshares were the second most common, while those about warranties and protection plans came in third.

Telemarketers are prohibited from using automated dialers to call cellphones or landlines on the list, unless the owners of these numbers give them consent first.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, listing your number on this list doesn't stop all robocalls. That's because many of the companies or scammers behind these calls won't hesitate to ignore Federal Communications Commission regulations.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Use call-blocking apps</h3>\n<p>Once you've listed your number on the Do Not Call Registry, it's time to download call-blocking apps that can help you prevent repeat robocalls from the same number. The <a href=\"https://mrnumber.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Number app</a> is a popular one, and allows you to block any number that has sent you a robocall and calls from known scammers. You can also block calls from numbers not in your contact list.</p>\n<p>There are competitors out there, including apps such as <a href=\"https://www.truecaller.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Truecaller</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shouldianswer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Should I Answer</a>. These will help you greatly reduce robocalls.</p>\n<p>Wireless providers understand that robocalls are a nuisance, too. So it's not surprising that some of these providers offer their own call-blocking apps. AT&amp;T offers the <a href=\"https://www.att.com/features/security-apps.html\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T Call Protect</a> app that lets you block calls from suspicious numbers and past robocallers. T-Mobile provides its own <a href=\"https://explore.t-mobile.com/callprotection?irgwc=1&amp;cmpid=WTR_AF_&amp;clickid=Vue3dj0vtTZuRm5WE2wp73T-UkjyWCRLETRN1Q0&amp;iradid=187812&amp;irpid=27795&amp;ircid=3290&amp;sharedid=&amp;aam=aam_uuid&amp;invoca=invoca_experience&amp;irmpname=VigLink\" target=\"_blank\">Scam Block</a> tool that allows cell users to block all known scam calls before they ring up their phones. And Verizon offers its own suite of <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/homephone/calling-features/stop-unwanted-calls\" target=\"_blank\">call-blocking services</a>, including call block, caller ID, and anonymous call rejection.</p>\n<h2>What to do if you still get robocalls</h2>\n<p>What if, despite the measures you've taken to prevent them, you still receive a robocall?</p>\n<p>First, if your call is coming from a number you don't recognize, don't answer. If the call truly is important, whoever is calling will leave you a voicemail. If you do answer, hang up as soon as you realize you're dealing with a robocall.</p>\n<p>Some robocalls will request that you hit the number \"1\" to speak with a live operator. Never do this. You'll just be connected with someone trying to sell you something or scam you. Others might ask that you press a certain number on your phone to stop receiving calls. Don't press that number, either. You'll usually be connected to another operator who wants to sell you or scam you.</p>\n<p>In short, the best way to deal with robocalls that slip through is to never engage with them. Robocallers can't scam you if you don't answer.

However, some of us take it more seriously than others. And some of us have to take it seriously, because our professional success relies heavily on staying connected. Then there are people who are on their accounts all the time, even when they're trying to do other things, like hang out with actual people. But are you one of those people whose obsessed with social media? How would you even know?</p>\n<p>If you're worried about how much time you're wasting on various platforms, here are a few signs that it's time for a social media detox.

You feel anxious when you're not scrolling</h2>\n<p>When you're not online, do you wish you were? Do you wonder what you're missing, hope that people aren't doing anything fun without you, or just feel anxious when you can't be on social media for a while? This anxiety can be a sign that you need to take a break. You should feel more anxious about missing your real life than you do about your online one. Separating from social media for a period of time can help you realize that the world doesn't end when you're not liking posts and battling trolls.</p>\n<h2>2. The photos you see upset you</h2>\n<p>Do you regularly see photos of other people's lives that make you feel sad or envious? Do you wish you had that kind of access to fancy homes, creativity, or style? If you're constantly comparing yourself to people online and feeling like you fall short, it may be time to unplug. Take the time to remember how good your own life is.

You never put down your phone</h2>\n<p>Is your phone always in your hand or nearby, even when you're supposed to be working or having a real-life conversation? If you can't stop checking social media, it's time to put the phone down and walk away. Your online social life doesn't have to interfere with your real one. Delete some of the apps off your phone until they lose their hold over you.</p>\n<h2>4. You post about your life before you live it</h2>\n<p>When you're out living your life, do you stage photos specifically for social media? Are you spending a significant amount of time thinking of pithy statements to tweet? Do you think about what to post, or when, or how, even while you're in the middle of doing something fun or actively engaged in an activity? If you think about staging your life for Facebook or Instagram before you live it, it's time to put the phone in your pocket and enjoy what's in front of you.

You check social media without thinking about it</h2>\n<p>What do you do when you're bored? Do you automatically go online, just to be sure you haven't missed anything? If your first line of defense against boredom to check your social media accounts, or the first thing you do while you're waiting, you may need to take a break and find other, more meaningful ways to spend your time. Set up other things to do when you would usually check your accounts mindlessly, and take back your time, and your life.

Social media interferes with your productivity</h2>\n<p>Are you online when you should be doing something important? Do work tasks get put off or not done at all because you're scrolling and tweeting instead? If social media is interfering with your productivity, or your to-do list never gets done because you're online, make some changes today. Delete your most addictive apps and download a few task management apps instead to keep you focused.

You make excuses to check in often</h2>\n<p>When you're out with friends or family, do you find yourself making excuses for checking your social accounts? Maybe you tell them that it's for work, or you go to the bathroom with your phone just so you can check your notifications. If social media has such a strong pull on your life that your loved ones are calling you out and you're making excuses to stay connected, then it's high time to disconnect.</p>\n<h2>8. You're disengaging from your real life</h2>\n<p>Do you choose to be online rather than go out with friends? Sure, we all need the occasional evening in, but if you are regularly choosing social media over your friends, or choosing not to go out because you're afraid you'll miss something online, it's time to think about a break. Social media can have a place in your life, but it shouldn't frequently take the place of real-life interactions.

There's something magical about splurging for a week away to try new activities with the kids. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/yes-affordable-family-travel-is-possible?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Yes, Affordable Family Travel Is Possible</a>)</p>\n<p>No dishes. No bills. No work calls or meetings with the boss. Just you and your kids enjoying life. We all need a break from the minutiae of daily life, right?</p>\n<p>Still, traveling with kids isn't all rainbows and cupcakes; it's also notoriously exhausting. Sleeping in a hotel room with children can be a challenge on its own, but there are also nap times, snack times, and meltdowns to deal with. It helps if the parents get a break every now and then.</p>\n<p>The ideal scenario is one where you travel with kids but also have a baby sitter on hand. You may not need full-time help, but even an hour or two each day can give you some space to relax in your own way. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/9-things-you-must-do-if-youre-traveling-with-kids?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">9 Things You Must Do If You're Traveling With Kids</a>)</p>\n<p>If you are someone who loves the idea of having child-care on a family vacation, consider these strategies.</p>\n<h2>1. Plan a vacation with built-in child-care</h2>\n<p>There are a few trips you can book where child-care is ready and waiting for you, the first of which is all-inclusive resorts. Many of these resorts are on the beach in destinations like the Caribbean and Mexico, and they offer your food, drink, lodging, and entertainment for one price.</p>\n<p>The majority of all-inclusive resorts also offer dedicated kids' clubs where you can drop your kids off for a few hours or the entire day. Some only allow you to drop off your kids for a few hours at a time, while others are open from morning until night.</p>\n<p>There are some <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/all-inclusive-resorts-you-can-book-for-free-with-points?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">all-inclusive resorts you can book with points</a> as well. The Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall in Montego Bay, Jamaica, for example, costs just 25,000 points per night (double occupancy) plus a 12,500 point per night supplement for each child. This resort includes food, drink, and fun, plus a kids' club that is open all day.</p>\n<h2>2. Book a cruise</h2>\n<p>Cruises are notorious for offering family-friendly (and affordable) fun, but part of that is the fact they have on-site child-care. The vast majority of major cruise lines offer some kind of kids' club that is open most or all of the day. Some cruise lines will even watch your child while you leave the ship at your cruise stop for the day.</p>\n<p>Many onboard kids' clubs offer much more than baby-sitting as well. On the MSC Divina, for example, kids participate in language lessons, crafts, games, and trivia. Not only are you getting child-care, but you're giving your children a unique experience of their own.</p>\n<h2>3. Travel with another family and swap baby-sitting</h2>\n<p>Imagine your family decides to rent a beach house with another family. You may save money by splitting the costs, and it can be convenient to have more adult eyes on all the kids. If you swap a night or two of baby-sitting, everybody wins.</p>\n<p>Still, this scenario won't always work. You would have to be able to settle on a place to stay with another family, and you would need to get along reasonably well to avoid conflict. Having access to child-care wouldn't be worth it if your family was miserable, so you would need to choose your tripmates wisely. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/beyond-disney-8-affordable-family-destinations-in-the-us?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond Disney: 8 Affordable Family Destinations in the U.S.</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Book child-care through your hotel</h2>\n<p>While some hotels offer kids' clubs, there are just as many that offer child-care you can book separately from your room rate. If you stay at select Walt Disney Resorts, for example, you can book in-room baby-sitting starting at $18 per hour for one child ($21 for two; $24 for three; $26 for four). It's not cheap by any means, but it can give you a break to go out to dinner or enjoy some quiet time.</p>\n<p>Many Omni hotel properties also offer kids' clubs and baby-sitting for a fee. At the Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, a full day of child-care with lunch costs $77 for the first child and $57 for each additional child, for example.</p>\n<h2>5. Bring a vacation nanny on your trip</h2>\n<p>If you're taking a special trip and don't mind splurging, you can also bring a vacation nanny along. This might work best if someone you know is able to travel and care for your children. You would need to pay all their travel expenses at the very least, and you will likely need to pay them a daily rate as well.</p>\n<p>You could also <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-affordable-vacations-to-please-every-age-group?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">plan a multigenerational trip</a>, potentially bringing a grandparent or set of grandparents along. You may secure some child-care that way, although you should ask ahead of time to make sure your expectations will be met.</p>\n<p>If you don't know anyone who would work, you can also use a service to hire a vacation nanny. For example, NannyPoppinz.com makes it easy to hire vetted nannies that will travel where you are and provide child-care during your trip.</p>\n<p>For this to work, however, you would need to feel comfortable spending your vacation with a stranger. You would also need to have a relatively large vacation rental (suite, rental condo, rental home, etc.) so your nanny could have their own space. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-handle-world-travel-with-your-family?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Travel Internationally With Your Kids</a>)</p>\n<h2>6. Use child-care websites to find sitters nearby</h2>\n<p>If none of the above scenarios work for you, consider hiring as-needed baby-sitting in the destinations where you're traveling. Care.com and SitterCity.com are good resources when it comes to finding baby-sitting wherever you plan to be.</p>\n<p>According to Care.com, vacation baby sitters are paid an average rate of $12.50 per hour. The website makes it possible to browse options in your destination, read over caregiver qualifications, and ask questions.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you'll find someone who can baby-sit while you enjoy a dinner out, a daylong snorkeling trip, or a special event.

That meant Dad had some very strong opinions about insurance in general, and life insurance in particular. He was not shy about sharing those opinions with a captive audience — aka, his daughter.</p>\n<p>Even though I heard Dad opine (and rant!) on any number of finance-related subjects, the viewpoint that stuck with me most was Dad's stance on life insurance for children.</p>\n<p>\"There is no reason whatsoever to ever buy such a product,\" he told me on more than one occasion. \"Life insurance is for income replacement. Policies for children are morbid.\"</p>\n<p>While part of Dad's objection to life insurance for kids stemmed from the exploitative practices you can find among disreputable insurance salespeople, he was also quick to admit that his own superstitions about tempting your children's fate added to his distaste for the products.</p>\n<p>Though dear old Dad was right more often than not, I have come to see much more value in children's life insurance than he did. Here are some compelling things to consider before purchasing life insurance for your child. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/term-vs-whole-life-insurance-heres-how-to-choose?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Term vs Whole Life Insurance: Here's How to Choose</a>)</p>\n<h2>Funeral expenses</h2>\n<p>The average funeral in America costs about $10,000. Financial experts (including my father) might say that parents needing to pay such expenses for a child should use their savings to do so. But considering the fact that half of all Americans couldn't come up with $400 in an emergency, the expert opinion may not match most people's financial reality.</p>\n<p>My dad did have an answer to this objection, however. There are many funeral homes that will offer their services free of charge for families who cannot afford the burial costs of losing a child.</p>\n<p>That means parents who are considering life insurance for their children just because of the potential cost of final expenses might not actually need a policy. Not only is it unlikely that you will ever need the insurance payout, since it's relatively rare for children to die, but you will likely be able to find financial help or free-of-cost services if the worst should happen.</p>\n<h2>Income replacement</h2>\n<p>Dad made it clear that he believed life insurance was for income replacement only. So unless you're raising a child star, there is no reason to purchase a policy for your kid. (And you didn't want to get Dad started on parents who pushed their kids into show business.)</p>\n<p>However, Dad's view didn't consider <em>whose</em> income will need to be replaced after the death of a child. The majority of children do not have an income, of course — but it's important to remember the very real cost of grief. Heartbroken parents may find themselves paralyzed by their grief and unable to work.</p>\n<p>Having a financial cushion can help keep a family afloat during a terrible time when work may be the last thing on anyone's mind. If you absolutely have to bring in every cent of your paycheck to manage your family's finances, a life insurance policy for your kids could potentially protect you all from the devastating costs of grief.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Coverage protection</h2>\n<p>Something that never came up in Dad's comments about children's life insurance was the importance of future insurability. While a child's life insurance policy is generally much smaller than those purchased by adults, they will often include a rider known as the guaranteed additional purchase (GAP) that a child can rely on once he or she reaches adulthood. This GAP rider will allow the child to purchase additional coverage as an adult without medical questions or underwriting.</p>\n<p>I have seen firsthand just how important such coverage protection can be. My best friend's son was diagnosed with autism at 15 months of age. My friend had not purchased a life insurance policy for her baby, even though she had intended to do so.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this means her son is now permanently ineligible for life insurance because of his autism diagnosis. Once he reaches adulthood, he will not be able to purchase a policy for himself. And autism is only one of several juvenile medical diagnoses — including diabetes, severe asthma, cancer, or a heart condition — that can render a child ineligible for life insurance in the future.</p>\n<p>This is why my friend now recommends that every parent buy life insurance for their children when they are still babies. At the very least, it will allow the child to have coverage throughout his or her life, no matter what medical surprises may be in store.</p>\n<h2>Don't fall for the \"investment\" promises</h2>\n<p>Many children's life insurance policies provide an option to cash out the policy once the child reaches adulthood. There is nothing wrong with this — unless you are worried your kids will cash out the policy and go on a shopping binge — but it is hardly the \"investment\" that it is often touted to be. (In fact, you could make Dad go purple with outrage just by mentioning it.)</p>\n<p>For instance, the Gerber Grow-Up Plan, one of the most commonly advertised life insurance products for children, promises that \"each time you make a monthly premium payment for your [policy], Gerber Life sets aside a small amount of money. Over time, this becomes the cash value of your policy. It represents how much your policy is worth at any given point in time.\"</p>\n<p>However, the cash value can potentially be less than the amount you have paid in premiums, since only a portion of your premiums are set aside. And the cash value will certainly be less than you would have earned through a traditional investment had you invested the premiums instead.</p>\n<p>While there are legitimate reasons for choosing a life insurance policy for your child, the investment strategy is not one of them.</p>\n<h2>Buying life insurance for your kids is a personal decision</h2>\n<p>Despite my about-face on children's life insurance, my two sons are still uninsured. Dad's superstition about tempting fate has stuck with me — and my husband and I are lucky enough to be in a financial situation where we could handle the monetary costs if something terrible should happen. My only big concern is if either of my kids receive a diagnosis that will make them ineligible for future insurance. But we have decided to live with that risk.</p>\n<p>It's important that all parents think through the full consequences of buying or not buying life insurance for their children. It is a distressing train of thought, but a necessary one. No matter what you choose, a well-thought out decision will lead you to what's best for your family.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Many of us can remember our parents complaining that money didn't grow on trees and grumbling over wasted money every time we left a light on or took too long in the shower. As our parents get older, however, roles and responsibilities start to switch. Eventually, a time comes when we have to have the talk about money with our parents.</p>\n<p>Sharing financial advice with your parents can be challenging and uncomfortable, but it is an essential talk to have. Here's how you can go about discussing money with your aging parents in both a respectful and productive way.</p>\n<h2>Set up a meeting</h2>\n<p>It can be hard to talk seriously when kids are running around or when the family is supposed to be enjoying a fun night together. Don't put a damper on a family get together by blindsiding your parents with bank statements. Instead, arrange to talk over coffee or breakfast, or even agree to meet with a financial adviser or estate planner if you think that will make the meeting go smoother.

From your perspective, it might seem like your parents have been careless with finances, but there is a chance that you don't know the whole story. Instead, approach them on mutual grounds.</p>\n<p>Instead of being accusatory, invite discussion. Start off the conversation with something like, \"I would love to discuss what you would you want me to do if there comes a time that I need to be your full-time caregiver,\" or, \"I know you mentioned that you wanted to set aside money for your grandkids' education, and I would love to know more about it so that it is done in a way that the kids aren't penalized if they need to apply for financial aid later on.\"</p>\n<h2>Offer help</h2>\n<p>Ask Mom and Dad if there is anything you can do to help lighten their load. They might need someone to teach them how to access their bank info online, do their taxes, or help them prepare a will. Sometimes parents feel embarrassed about asking their kids to take over financially, and may not be ready to hand over the reins right away. You can still extend the invitation by saying something like, \"If there ever comes a time where you don't want to deal with budgeting/paying bills/etc., let me know and I will gladly help out as much as possible.\"</p>\n<h2>Ask for access to their important financial information</h2>\n<p>There are no guarantees in life. You never know when your parents will pass away or become fully dependent on you. It is important to have a list of their financial information so that you can access it when the time comes. Here are some important things to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Social Security numbers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Financial information for each bank, investment, retirement, and debt account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All insurance information, including health, long-term care, and life insurance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Estate planning documents such as will, trust, and power of attorney.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real estate papers, such as deed and title.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact information for all financial advisers, accountants, lawyers, etc.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Create a future plan</h2>\n<p>According to AARP, 30 million households care for an adult over 50, and that number is expected to double in 25 years. Share that statistic with your parents and explain to them that while you don't like imagining them getting older, that is going to happen regardless — and you want their guidance and advice before that time comes. Ask them what living arrangements they want when they can't care for themselves and how they want their finances, assets, and property dealt with after passing.

Does their will and power of attorney for health and finances reflect what they want it to reflect? If not, encourage them to update these legal documents as soon as possible. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-things-youll-encounter-when-taking-over-a-loved-ones-finances?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Things You'll Encounter When Taking Over a Loved One's Finances</a>)</p>\n<h2>Have patience and get the family involved</h2>\n<p>Don't expect to conquer your parents' financial future in one go. Depending on how complicated their finances are, it might take several talks and several prompts of encouragement to get things on the right track. If possible, have other siblings get involved in these financial conversations. Show siblings that if they keep borrowing money from Mom and Dad, they will drain them of essential money needed to pay for health care and living expenses down the road.</p>\n<p>Talking about money is already an uncomfortable and unpopular topic. Add your parents to the mix, and things can get hairy and emotional quick. Remember to go slow and come from a place of love.

Raising kids in a two-parent household can be stressful enough; being a single parent can be downright overwhelming.</p>\n<p>When it comes to managing household finances, being a single parent isn't necessarily different from any other household with children. Instead, there just may not be a lot of financial flexibility — so there's more pressure to get things right early on. Take a breath and work toward reaching these financial markers to give you peace of mind.</p>\n<h2>1. Prepare your estate planning documents</h2>\n<p>People tend to procrastinate about getting their estate paperwork in place, but it's a smart idea for everyone to make it a priority. Experiencing a major life event, like having a child, should prompt you to either update your old documents or establish an estate plan.</p>\n<p>Unless you're comfortable leaving your personal and financial decisions up to state officials, it makes sense to sit with an attorney to discuss your wishes should you pass away or become incapacitated and unable to make financial and health decisions for yourself. Since minor children cannot take control of inheritance money or make legal decisions, listing them as direct beneficiaries on your accounts and assuming that will accomplish your goals may not be the case. Every parent should also have guardianship papers in place, especially if they are raising children alone. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/heres-what-happens-if-you-dont-leave-a-will?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Here's What Happens If You Don't Leave a Will</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Purchase life insurance</h2>\n<p>Generally, if someone is dependent on your income, you probably need life insurance. While you'll want to sit with a financial adviser or life insurance agent to discuss how much insurance you need, some factors to consider are how much it will cost to raise your children and send them to college, as well as to protect certain assets and pay off debt. You'll also want to consult an attorney or financial professional about properly selecting a policy beneficiary. While there are various types of life insurance, a term life insurance policy can be an affordable and efficient way to protect your family. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/term-vs-whole-life-insurance-heres-how-to-choose?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Term vs Whole Life Insurance: Here's How to Choose</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Fund an emergency savings account</h2>\n<p>Having a fully funded cash reserve on hand is a critical component of everyone's personal financial health. In a one-income household with children, it's recommended to work toward having <em>at least</em> six months' worth of monthly bills and expenses saved and set aside. Once you reach six months' worth, aim for a year's worth. In a two-parent household, one adult may be able to cut back on essentials in the case of a job loss, but when children are financially dependent on you and <em>only</em> you for everything, that can be difficult to manage without a padding of emergency cash. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-minute-finance-start-an-emergency-fund?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5-Minute Finance: Start an Emergency Fund</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Contribute to a retirement account</h2>\n<p>After fortifying your financial house with savings and the proper risk management documents in place, you should focus on saving for your own retirement. As a parent, you naturally put your children's needs and wants before your own, and there is nothing wrong with that. But it's also important to recognize that your early working years are critical to your retirement savings goals. There are no do-overs when it comes to saving for retirement, and every year you don't save is a year lost.</p>\n<p>If you have access to a retirement plan at work such as a 401(k), strive to save 15 percent of your total income. If money is tight and your employer offers a match, start by contributing just enough to earn the full match. Over time, you can gradually increase your own contributions. If you don't have access to a workplace retirement plan (or in addition to one), you should open an IRA, which you can do at a discount brokerage firm or bank. For 2018, anyone with earned income under the age of 50 can contribute the lesser of $5,500 or their total yearly income. Make this a priority and make this a habit.

Open a 529 account</h2>\n<p>A 529 plan is a tax-favored education savings account that allows individuals to save for future qualified education costs. Contributions are made on an after-tax basis, and the money grows tax-free. Distributions for qualified education expenses are also tax-free. Once you set up an account, anyone can make contributions to it; for example, grandparents could contribute on behalf of a grandchild. Even if you don't have enough money in your current budget to make regular contributions, saving your child's birthday, holiday, or other gift money they receive throughout the year can be a helpful way to see your funds grow.</p>\n<p>Covering the entire cost of your child's (or children's) college education is a difficult task for any set of parents, so don't feel guilty about what you may or may not be able to accomplish with this account. Every little bit helps.

Maybe you're looking for a new career, or perhaps you're just looking to build a side hustle that will bring in a few extra bucks. Either way, selling what you know online could turn out to be a great little earner for you.</p>\n<p>There are various ways to sell your knowledge over the internet, depending on what you are selling and the format you use. A few years ago, it might have required an advanced understanding of technology or a load of cash to get your idea off the ground, but these days, there are plenty of ways to get going with minimal upfront investment — making it easy for anyone with a computer and an internet connection to start a side hustle.

Write an ebook</h2>\n<p>It used to be that if you couldn't find a traditional publishing house that accepted your manuscript, then you'd have no other choice but to pay to have it printed yourself. Luckily, ebooks have blown the publishing world wide open and have enabled almost anyone to produce and sell a story directly to readers with very few costs attached. It also means that books are extremely quick to create. You can have your ebook ready to go not long after it's written.</p>\n<p>To go through Amazon, you can write the ebook in your normal word processing software, then format it with <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/GHU4YEWXQGNLU94T\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Create</a>, and create a cover for it in a free design program like <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Canva</a>. You can then self-publish it through Amazon's <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Direct Publishing</a>.</p>\n<p>But for wider distribution, look also at <a href=\"https://press.barnesandnoble.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NookPress</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/writinglife?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=5credit1F&amp;utm_campaign=kwl-branded&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-qO5r8u_2wIVQ57ACh2bSA8kEAAYASAAEgLqsPD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Kobo Writing Life</a>, which are other self-publishing platforms. For the widest reach possible, it's best to publish with all of the major players rather than sticking to a single one.</p>\n<h2>2. Host webinars</h2>\n<p>Hosting live webinar sessions allows you to share your knowledge to an audience without the need for them to be physically present. It's like a conference or seminar but done on a remote basis, saving learners the cost of travel and accommodation. The real benefit of webinars is that you can interact with your audience as you go, by allowing real-time questions or holding a Q&amp;A session at the end. This ensures that everyone gets exactly what they want from the session.</p>\n<p>Webinars can be simple presentations carried out on Skype or even Facebook Live, but more advanced tools will allow you to create better, more engaging seminars. Google Hangouts is free to use and has numerous collaborative features perfect for hosting web sessions.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, there are various paid software tools such as GoToMeeting or Cisco Webex that are specifically for designing and conducting webinars. You need to have an audience large enough to make it worth your while, so it helps if you already have a following on social media or a website to allow you to publicize the event.

Become an online consultant</h2>\n<p>For people with a sought after skill set that businesses want to access, online consulting works extremely well. There are many reasons why businesses prefer to work with online consultants rather than those who physically come onto the work premises. These range from not wanting to upset the workforce with an outsider's presence while still benefiting from a pair of fresh eyes, to the simple reality that it's often less costly to hire an online consultant while still receiving an expert level of service.</p>\n<p>It helps to have a niche skill that you have proven expertise in, as this will lend you much needed credibility. Getting started in online consulting can be difficult, so it's vital to use any and all contacts you already have to get your first break. Once you have your first few contracts secured, you will hopefully begin to get referrals or recommendations and see a snowball effect.</p>\n<h2>4. Provide online tutoring</h2>\n<p>Online tutoring is a great way to share your experience with people who want to learn one-on-one with an expert in their chosen subject. You don't need to have a degree in education, but you’ll need skills or knowledge in something that people are willing to pay to learn. Subjects like English, math, and science, are particularly in demand. However, it's possible to tutor online on other topics such as foreign languages (or English as a foreign language), or even learning an instrument.</p>\n<p>There are numerous online agencies that match people with tutors in their chosen subject, so you won't have to actively search or advertise for clients. Generally, you fill out an application and they decide whether they accept you or not. Once you've been accepted and have registered, they will send you jobs as they become available.

Create an online course</h2>\n<p>If you have knowledge that you want to spread far and wide, and know there's an audience there to lap it up, then an online course may be the right path for you. Online courses allow you to reach more people than you could on a one-on-one basis, both from a time perspective, and also because you can sell a course much cheaper than individual tutoring.</p>\n<p>It's a huge amount of work initially to design and build your course, but once this is done, the course should provide passive income with little to no further effort. There are various delivery methods that you'll have to select, depending on what you want to achieve. Courses that email your lessons to students are easy to set up with providers such as MailChimp, or you can put your materials out in module format with the Udemy marketplace.

Thankfully, they don't need it — because plenty of free, open source software is available online at the click of a button.</p>\n<p>Many of the free versions of business software cover, at minimum, the basic needs required by startups and self-employed individuals. Check out a few below. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-helpful-tools-to-manage-your-small-business?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Helpful Tools to Manage Your Small Business</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Google Drive</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Drive</a> is a free service that gives users access to spreadsheets, word processing, slideshows, and form software. The drive is tied to Gmail accounts. Each user has access to 15GB of cloud storage under a free account.</p>\n<p>These free tools don't have the same level of robust options as Microsoft's suite of office software, but they offer most of the common features that small businesses will be looking for. As an added bonus, the documents are updated in real time, so it's a solid choice for companies that do real-time collaboration on projects.</p>\n<p>Drive allows users to upload and download documents in a Microsoft format, so you will not have problems sharing documents with clients, customers, or partners who utilize Office.</p>\n<h2>2. LibreOffice</h2>\n<p>LibreOffice is a free collection of open source office tools that gives users access to downloadable spreadsheets, word processing, and presentation software. It's important that you only download the software on the <a href=\"https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/\" target=\"_blank\">LibreOffice website</a> to avoid potential computer viruses.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is a pretty solid alternative to Microsoft Office. LibreOffice Writer has most of the major and minor features found in Microsoft Word. LibreOffice Calc also has similar features to Excel, but Microsoft macro and programming language can't be imported from Calc to Microsoft Excel. The presentation software (Impress) has similar compatibility issues with PowerPoint.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that LibreOffice is a good alternative if your business doesn't receive Excel files with macros and doesn't need to send presentations to individuals who utilize PowerPoint.</p>\n<h2>3. Evernote</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://evernote.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Evernote</a> is a \"freemium\" application (free to download and use, with additional paid features) that can be used for word processing, slideshows, note taking, and document storage. The main perk of the platform is the ability to easily store and organize various types of documents in one place.</p>\n<p>The basic platform is free and allows users to upload 20MB of new content each month and sync it across two devices. It's a neat tool, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as your sole project management software. The basic freemium plan doesn't offer a robust means of sharing documents internally and externally.</p>\n<h2>4. Prezi</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://prezi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Prezi</a> is online presentation software. A basic, free account allows individuals to create an unlimited number of presentations, but has no miscellaneous options, such as offline sync, privacy controls, or revocable shared links.</p>\n<p>The tool, despite its limited scope, is worth evaluating because the presentations that can be created aren't typical, old-fashioned slideshows. Presentations are shown on large slides that offer the presenter smart capabilities like zooming in on certain details.</p>\n<h2>5. Trello</h2>\n<p>The basic, free version of project management software <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Trello</a> gives members the ability to create an unlimited number of lists, cards, and checklists. Members can upload up to 10MB of files.</p>\n<p>The free version of Trello only has two major downsides. First, basic accounts lack the ability to put the lists and cards into collections to make the system easier to navigate. Second, users aren't able to remove group members. The basic account relies heavily on the honor system and managers externally policing how individuals interact with the tool. As your company grows, you might want to invest in a paid project management and organization tool.</p>\n<h2>6. SurveyMonkey</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SurveyMonkey</a> is a survey creation tool. The free version allows individuals to create a 10 question survey. Each survey can have up to 100 responses.</p>\n<p>Which should you use, Google Forms or Survey Monkey? Survey Monkey tends to be a tad more aesthetically pleasing, but Google Forms allow the survey to have more than 10 questions. I'd recommend using Google Forms if you regularly create long surveys.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>7. Buffer</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://buffer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buffer</a> is a social media management platform that serves as a valuable marketing tool. A basic, free Buffer account allows users to manage up to three social accounts at one time. Each account can have 10 posts in the schedule queue.</p>\n<p>Due to the limitations, I'd recommend this for businesses or individuals who don't rely heavily on preplanning a large number of social media posts. The free plan also, unfortunately, does not give users access to valuable analytics data for a more targeted social campaign.</p>\n<p>Despite those restrictions, it can be a valuable tool for small businesses and freelancers until they can invest in a more robust social media management plan.</p>\n<h2>8. Google Hangouts</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Hangouts</a> allows organizations to create video calls, phone calls, and online chat forums. The tools are free and can be accessed through users' Gmail accounts.</p>\n<p>Video and audio calls can have up to 10 active participants; individuals who video call can use screen share to give presentations, as well as share documents, websites, and videos. Google Conversations — the chat feature of Hangouts — can have up to 150 participants.</p>\n<h2>9. Slack</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack's</a> main function serves as a robust interface for team chat and collaboration. The free version also has the ability to make one-on-one voice and video calls, offers 5GB of file storage, and allows users to search through a history of the previous 10,000 messages.</p>\n<h2>10. Audacity</h2>\n<p>Audacity is open source audio editing software that can be downloaded on Microsoft, Mac, and Linux computers. You should only download the software from the <a href=\"https://www.audacityteam.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\">official Audacity website</a>.</p>\n<p>Audacity allows users to import or record audio files. Once audio files are uploaded or recorded, they can be combined and edited. The first time a business or freelancer utilizes the software to create a piece of audio content, I'd recommend they consult one of the dozens of video guides available on YouTube. Experts of the software can, at the very least, give inexperienced recorders tips that might save them hours of work.</p>\n<h2>11. GIMP</h2>\n<p>GIMP is a free photo editing program that is compatible with most operating systems. Like LibreOffice and Audacity, GIMP should be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">official GIMP website</a>.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that GIMP, as an open source, community-built program, isn't as advanced as Adobe Photoshop. GIMP has basic editing functions, but lacks many of the higher quality functions present in Photoshop.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals who either lack the capital to invest in Photoshop or don't require advanced photo editing software should give GIMP a try.</p>\n<h2>12. Canva</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Canva</a> is a \"freemium\" graphic design tool that lets businesses and freelancers create featured images and graphs that can be utilized on their websites, blogs, or promotional materials. Canva can be accessed online or by downloading the app on a variety of tablets and smartphones.</p>\n<p>A free Canva account has 1GB of storage and gives up to 10 team members access to the software. Novice image editors can streamline the photo editing process by choosing one of the 8,000 image templates as a guide. Users can either upload their own images or purchase an image through Canva.</p>\n<p>If you're not quite up to delving into GIMP for your photo editing needs, Canva can be easier to utilize.</p>\n\n        \n      \n      \n              <div id=\"below-content\" class=\"mobile-ad\">\n                  </div>\n      \n    </div>", "body_type": "html", "lang": "en", "timestamp": "2025-10-13T04:44:50.426206"}

Your children just want to enjoy time together, and there are plenty of ways to do that on a budget. Here are 28 free ways you can have a blast with them.</p>\n<h2>1. Head to the library</h2>\n<p>The library is a great resource for free books, and you can make your trip even more enjoyable by letting your kids pick out any books that interest them or by using a <a href=\"https://www.freekidscrafts.com/printable-library-scavenger-hunt/\" target=\"_blank\">printable library scavenger hunt</a> to discover new reads. It will keep them busy, they'll have tons of fun, and they'll end up with new books to enjoy. Check your library's calendar for fun activities and story times as well. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-modern-reasons-to-visit-your-local-library-today?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Modern Reasons to Visit Your Local Library Today</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Turn your backyard into a water park</h2>\n<p>Turn on the sprinklers, have your kids change into swimsuits, and allow them to run wild. You can also add a tarp and some dish soap for a DIY slip and slide. It's really the perfect way to keep cool on a hot summer day.</p>\n<h2>3. Host a family game night</h2>\n<p>Pull out your board games and dedicate a whole night to playing a game together as a family. If you have a big family, you can play the games as teams and compete for a prize like, the winner gets to pick the movie on movie night, or the last place team has to do the dusting for the next week.

Let them play dress up in your clothes</h2>\n<p>Who needs fancy dress up costumes when Mom and Dad have dresses and suits to throw on? See what funny combos your kids can come up with and even organize a mock fashion show.</p>\n<h2>5. Create a fort in the living room</h2>\n<p>Hunkering down inside a homemade fort is a fun activity for kids and adults alike. All you need is a few chairs, some sheets or blankets, and a lot of comfy pillows to make the perfect indoor fort.</p>\n<h2>6. Have a camp out in the backyard</h2>\n<p>A camping trip won't always fit your schedule or budget, but you can still enjoy the experience by pitching a tent in the backyard. Roast hot dogs and s'mores outdoors with a grill or fire pit, tell ghost stories, and sleep under the stars. And make sure to use bug spray!</p>\n<h2>7. Bake some sweet treats</h2>\n<p>On a rainy day that can't be spent enjoying the summer sun, stay in and whip up some treats. Scour Pinterest for fun baking recipes to try out. What kid wouldn't want to make <a href=\"http://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/unicorn-poop-cookies/\" target=\"_blank\">unicorn poop cookies</a> or <a href=\"https://thedecoratedcookie.com/rainbow-smores-dip/\" target=\"_blank\">rainbow s'mores dip</a>?</p>\n<p>Or you can turn a regular meal into a game by letting the kids make funny food art. My girls always love when I turn their pancake breakfast into a dog, cat, or something holiday themed, like a turkey or Santa.</p>\n<h2>8. Have a picnic</h2>\n<p>Take meal time out in the fresh air with a picnic blanket and paper plates. Enjoy your family picnic at the park, in your backyard, or even in your living room if the weather isn't cooperating.</p>\n<h2>9. Make bath time extra fun</h2>\n<p>A bath with glow sticks, extra bubbles, or a few drops of food coloring can make tub time a blast. You can even add new toys or bring in water toys for the special occasion. Or you take bath time outside by filling a kiddie pool with bubble bath solution and letting kids get clean in their swimsuits.</p>\n<h2>10. Go hiking</h2>\n<p>A family hiking trip can be a wonderful bonding experience, especially if there is a lot of wildlife and plants to see along the way. Get kids more involved in the hike by making it a scavenger hunt or by bringing binoculars so they can birdwatch. <a href=\"https://www.americantrails.org/resources/statetrails/\" target=\"_blank\">American Trails</a> lists hiking and equestrian trails available in each state.

Have a spa day</h2>\n<p>Everyone loves a little pampering from time to time. Whip up DIY face masks for you and your kids from ingredients in the kitchen, like yogurt or avocado. Enjoy a bath with a homemade bath bomb or treat yourself and the kiddos to a mani/pedi and let them pick their own colors — even if it's a different color on each nail. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-spa-treatments-you-can-do-at-home?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Spa Treatments You Can Do at Home</a>)</p>\n<h2>12. Conduct a science experiment</h2>\n<p>No need to make your kids sit through a dull science lesson. Get them interested in the subject by trying fun experiments that will blow their minds like making <a href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/ice-cream3.htm\" target=\"_blank\">homemade ice cream</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Rock-Candy\" target=\"_blank\">rock candy</a>, or creating <a href=\"http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/experiments/invisibleink.html\" target=\"_blank\">invisible ink</a> for writing secret messages.</p>\n<h2>13. Hold an impromptu dance party</h2>\n<p>When your kids are complaining that they're bored or are fighting with each other, turn up the music and just start dancing. Watch the anger or antsiness fade into endorphins as they enjoy a subtle workout.</p>\n<h2>14. Visit Petsmart or Petco</h2>\n<p>My kids love going to the pet store just to walk around and look at the animals who've come in with their owners, and the smaller pets like fish that are available for adoption. Some locations have dog and cat adoption days on the weekends, so the kids can meet and pet four-legged friends, too!</p>\n<h2>15. Turn your garage into a roller skating rink</h2>\n<p>Clear out the garage, put on your skates, and blast some tunes for a fun DIY roller skating party. If you have a disco light, even better!</p>\n<p>You can also check out <a href=\"https://kidsskatefree.com/locations/\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Skate Free</a> to find free skating rink passes in your area.</p>\n<h2>16. Write and star in your own movie</h2>\n<p>Want your kids to take a break from the screen? Encourage them to make a movie or show of their own. If you don't have a video camera, you can use your smartphone and upload clips to a free movie editor, such as Blender or iMovie, to add special effects and cut and paste scenes.</p>\n<h2>17. Throw a tea party</h2>\n<p>Serve herbal tea, cookies, and tea sandwiches on your fanciest plates and drink with your pinkies up. Talk in accents or listen to a narrated audiobook like the <em>Harry Potter</em> series while you and your kids fancily dine.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>18. Blow some bubbles</h2>\n<p>Bubbles are not just for babies and toddlers. Older kids (and even adults) love them, too! Create giant bubbles with this <a href=\"https://happyhooligans.ca/homemade-giant-bubbles/\" target=\"_blank\">homemade recipe</a> or <a href=\"http://www.housingaforest.com/giant-ghost-bubbles-homemade-gak-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\">reusable bubbles</a> with items you already have on hand.</p>\n<h2>19. Try geocaching</h2>\n<p>Geocaching is where you hunt for a hidden object through GPS coordinates. Many people around the world have made the experience a thrilling one for families with kids to enjoy. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-outdoor-adventures-that-dont-cost-a-dime?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Outdoor Adventures That Don't Cost a Dime</a>)</p>\n<h2>20. Go bowling</h2>\n<p>Who doesn't love using a giant heavy ball to knock down several pins at once? Bowling is great for kids and adults, and it doesn't have to cost you a thing. Get free bowling passes through <a href=\"https://www.kidsbowlfree.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Bowl Free</a> or see if your local bowling alley gives away free games for good grades or birthdays.</p>\n<h2>21. Start a kids book club</h2>\n<p>Invite your children's friends over once a week for a book club meeting and read something that everyone will enjoy. Make themed snacks, crafts, or have the kids re-enact their favorite scenes.</p>\n<h2>22. Paint outside</h2>\n<p>Get creative without the mess. Use paint that you have on hand and make masterpieces on paper, rocks, or old shirts. You can even lay down an old bed sheet and let the kids paint with odd objects around the house, like a whisk or straw.</p>\n<h2>23. Set up a scavenger hunt</h2>\n<p>Hide a prize, such as a pan of brownies, and write and hide clues all over the house. They will have a blast solving riddles and trying to guess what the ultimate prize is.

Host family Olympic Games</h2>\n<p>Inspire some friendly competition among your family members by holding your own Olympic Games. If you have enough people to split into teams, you can even make your own uniforms with old T-shirts. Try fun games like a three-legged race, carrying an egg on a spoon, and water balloon toss.</p>\n<h2>25. Tour museums for free</h2>\n<p>Sign up for your local museum's mailing list to get notifications of free events and fee-free admission days. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-visit-museums-for-free?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Visit Museums for Free</a>)</p>\n<h2>26. Take a factory tour</h2>\n<p>Give your kids an inside look at people hard at work in various industries. Search <a href=\"http://www.factorytoursusa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FactoryToursUSA</a> under your state to discover free factory tours near you. There are 565 tours listed, and many of them with free or little admission cost.</p>\n<h2>27. Sign up for a free class</h2>\n<p>Many stores offer free classes for children. Check with your local library, bookstores, schools, and community center for more offerings.</p>\n<p>Here is a short list of free classes to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.americangirl.com/retail/\" target=\"_blank\">American Girl Store</a> occasionally offers free events and crafts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.michaels.com/classes\" target=\"_blank\">Michael's Craft store</a> offers free craft activities along with $2 and $5 craft classes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://shop.lego.com/en-US/minibuild-registration?ShipTo=US&amp;ShipTo=US&amp;_requestid=5506530&amp;_requestid=665480\" target=\"_blank\">LEGO store</a> allows children to complete a free mini-build once a month.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/workshops/?AID=11210757&amp;PID=8259874&amp;SID=103604X1560189X1bbde55f30fefa894195b95140e495a8&amp;cm_mmc=CJ-_-8259874-_-11210757&amp;cj=true#store/6651\" target=\"_blank\">HomeDepot</a> does a free workshop for kids each month.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>28. Visit a nearby farm</h2>\n<p>It's so important for kids to see where their food comes from, and visiting a local farm is the perfect way to show them. Use <a href=\"https://www.localharvest.org/\" target=\"_blank\">LocalHarvest</a> to find nearby farms and free events. You can also connect to pick-your-own farms near your area. Check to see if admission is free and if you can walk and picnic on the farm for free.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

It can also be expensive. A trip to the movies for a family of four can easily set you back $80 or more after the tickets and snacks. Entrance fees to water parks and amusement parks are just as expensive, and even a meal at a local restaurant can empty your wallet. But if you get creative, you can give the grandkids a great time without fretting about the cost.</p>\n<h2>1. Head to McDonald's</h2>\n<p>There's always an outcry from a select set of people when you mention McDonald's. Whatever you think of the golden arches franchise, it's hard to deny the convenience and wonder of the PlayPlace. It's completely free, it's well-maintained, and the kids <em>love</em> it. It's bright, it's full of other excited kids, and grandparents can watch the grandkids from a comfy bench. You don't even have to order a meal to access it. Split a coffee or bottle of water and watch the kids have a blast.</p>\n<h2>2. Check out a local playground</h2>\n<p>Most suburban housing areas have a Homeowners' Association (HOA) that takes care of garbage, snow removal, and the upkeep of a safe, secure playground. They usually have some kind of climbing frame, swings, monkey bars, and lots of room to play.</p>\n<p>You can often find several of these playgrounds within a few minutes' drive from each other, so take the kids on a kind of playground treasure hunt. Drive around the neighborhoods, and when they find a park they like, go play! There are usually benches right there at the park for the parents and grandparents to take a load off while the kids run around.</p>\n<h2>3. Visit the local public library</h2>\n<p>Your taxes have paid for this essential resource, and over the years public libraries have become modernized multimedia learning centers. You'll find all kinds of books, movies, and CDs that the kids will enjoy. Libraries also offer free activities for children, including readings by authors, movie screenings, puppet shows, crafts, science corners, and even poetry jams. Many libraries also offer refreshments at very reasonable prices, and have used books, DVDs, and CDs for sale at low prices. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-modern-reasons-to-visit-your-local-library-today?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Modern Reasons to Visit Your Local Library Today</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Take advantage of free days at national parks</h2>\n<p>While it usually costs a small fee, either per car or per person, visiting a national park on certain days of the year is actually free. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/fee-free-parks.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Those days in 2018</a> are January 15, April 21, September 22, and November 11. So pack a picnic and go see the sights at a national park for $0. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-save-on-national-park-visits-in-2018?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Save on National Park Visits in 2018</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Try a free craft session at Home Depot or Lowe's</h2>\n<p>Hardware stores know that by offering these free crafts for the kids, the parents will visit the store and end up making a purchase. But you don't have to buy anything. Simply visit your nearest <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/workshops/#change_store\" target=\"_blank\">Home Depot</a> or <a href=\"https://www.lowes.com/cd_Childrens+Corner+and+Gifts+at+Lowes_751688466_\" target=\"_blank\">Lowe's</a> when they next have a kid's craft session, and watch the grandkids have an awesome time assembling a bird feeder, or wooden car, or play with sand and special tools. Whatever the grandkids make, they get to keep and bring home. It's a fun, free activity that takes up a few hours, usually on a Saturday morning.</p>\n<h2>6. Take them to a free concert</h2>\n<p>Free summer concerts are usually hosted by counties looking to help increase trade at malls, farmers markets, or other shopping venues, and it works. People come out for the free music, and spend money on food trucks, toys, rides, and more. Again, you don't have to spend any money if you don't want to. Get online and search for \"free concerts near me\" and just watch the results come flooding in. They're usually outdoor, rain-or-shine events, and you will have to provide your own seats and blankets. But it's a great way to spend a few hours watching the grandkids dance and have fun, while getting involved in something positive for your community.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>7. Go bowling for free</h2>\n<p>Bowling centers in towns and cities all across America are participating in a program called <a href=\"https://www.kidsbowlfree.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Bowl Free</a>. Register your grandkids and they will each receive two free games of bowling each day over the summer, a giveaway valued at over $500 per child. Find out which centers near you are involved in the initiative. If you want to join in, many bowling centers offer discounted rates for seniors, and you can also find great deals on sites like Groupon and LivingSocial.</p>\n<h2>8. Have a picnic</h2>\n<p>Kids spend way too much time indoors these days, so get them outside to a local park for a family picnic. You don't have to do anything fancy, all you need are a few blankets, folding chairs, some snacks, and maybe a few balls and Frisbees for the kids to throw around.</p>\n<p>Before you head out, have the grandkids help with the food preparation. It's a great way to get them feeling more independent, and they'll be invested in the whole experience. Making sandwiches, bagging up fruits and veggies, and making lemonade or ice water is another fun activity for them. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/20-cheap-fun-things-to-do-this-summer?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">20 Cheap, Fun Things to Do This Summer</a>)</p>\n<h2>9. Visit a museum on a free day</h2>\n<p>Kids hear the word \"museum\" and they think of dusty sculptures, old paintings, and tired fossils. However, modern museums are jam-packed with the most incredible interactive exhibits, often showcasing great pop culture events. The recent <a href=\"http://www.powerofcostume.si.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Star Wars</em> and the Power of Costume</a> traveling exhibit from the Smithsonian was a smash hit, and kids everywhere flocked to the museums with their parents and grandparents.</p>\n<p>Most museums offer free days, and offer discounts for seniors, so plan a trip to a museum (they get busy on free days, so go early) and introduce your grandkids to the many wonders of the world. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-visit-museums-for-free?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Visit Museums for Free</a>)</p>\n<h2>10. Get them working in the garden</h2>\n<p>Don't make them do backbreaking work, but the kind of fun gardening that kids love to do. Have them help pulling weeds, plant flowers, prune bushes (with adult supervision), water the plants, and other gardening tasks that can be a chore for you, but a good time for them. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/13-simple-gardening-skills-anybody-can-master?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">13 Simple Gardening Skills Anybody Can Master</a>)</p>\n<h2>11. Turn the sprinklers on</h2>\n<p>While you're out in the garden, if it's a nice sunny day and the watering restrictions in your area allow it, get the sprinklers going. The grandkids can put on their swimsuits and run around in the water for hours. You can find cheap attachments at most major stores for hoses that are specifically designed to sprinkle out water in fun patterns, and you can also pick up a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LcHCAI\" target=\"_blank\">Slip 'n' Slide</a> for about $20.</p>\n<h2>12. Go fly a kite</h2>\n<p>Make a kite, and then go and fly it with the grandkids. There are instructions online for many different types of kites that you can make for pennies, using items you'll find around the house, or, you can pick up cool and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IR2JKE\" target=\"_blank\">colorful kites</a> for $10-$20. Then, go to a local park or a place that has plenty of space, and watch the grandkids go berserk when the kite hits new heights.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Most imply that you need to be rich, that only certain privileged people can travel, and that common life situations make it impossible to see the world. But safe and affordable travel is actually possible. Here are seven common travel myths that are flat-out wrong.</p>\n<h2>1. Traveling is too expensive</h2>\n<p>There's no doubt about it, traveling can absolutely be expensive. But that doesn't mean it <em>has </em>to be. If you're booking luxury cruises and five-star hotels every time you go on vacation, then yes, you'll need lots of cash. There are endless ways to make traveling easier on your budget, though, and all while enjoying a fantastic standard of living.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-wisely-choose-your-next-travel-destination?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Choosing the right destinations</a> is key, and outside of the U.S., many places are far cheaper on everything from food to accommodation. You can use travel rewards credit cards to save hundreds of dollars per year and get free travel perks. And <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/why-timing-is-everything-when-saving-money-on-travel?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">timing your trip</a> is another way to keep costs down, simply by traveling outside of peak seasons.</p>\n<h2>2. Travel credit cards are bad for your finances</h2>\n<p>Credit cards are only as dangerous as the person wielding them, so it's completely inaccurate to assume that the cards themselves are dangerous for your finances. When used correctly, <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/top-5-travel-reward-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">travel rewards cards</a> can actually be of huge benefit for travelers. They’re a great way to earn free bonuses just for doing your everyday spending, and savvy travelers use them to score everything from <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-tools-that-help-you-find-free-award-flights?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">free flights</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/which-credit-card-should-you-use-to-get-free-hotel-stays?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">free hotel stays</a>.</p>\n<p>Rewards credit cards are most suitable for people who are already debt-free and able to pay off their balance each month. It's also important not to increase your spending in order to gather rewards, as this will rarely make financial sense.</p>\n<h2>3. Couchsurfing is unsafe</h2>\n<p>Couchsurfing sometimes gets a bad rap, and people tend to focus on the few horror stories that appear in the news. The reality is that most people have a fantastic experience when couchsurfing, and trouble with hosts or guests is extremely rare. <a href=\"https://hippie-inheels.com/tips-for-safe-couchsurfing/\" target=\"_blank\">Travel blogger Rachel Jones</a> is a fan of couchsurfing, and has found that it gives her a more immersive local experience. She has even made long-lasting friendships through it. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/13-ways-to-get-free-travel-accommodations?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">13 Ways to Get Free Travel Accommodations</a>)</p>\n<p>There are precautionary steps you should take as a guest when looking for a couchsurfing opportunity that is right for you. First, read the host profiles carefully, particularly the reviews, as these will give you an insight into the person you'll be staying with. Second, always give a friend or family member the address you're heading to before you go, and arrange to check in with them throughout your stay. Finally, don't be afraid to walk away. If alarm bells ring in your head, listen to your instincts and leave.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Traveling with kids is a nightmare</h2>\n<p>Traveling with kids can be difficult, and it's certainly more complicated than traveling alone. But that doesn't mean that it should stop you from doing it. There are plenty of families successfully navigating the world with multiple kids in tow, and absolutely loving the experience.</p>\n<p>Some destinations are more child-friendly than others, so it pays to do your research before choosing. It will also take a bit more planning to find suitable accommodations and ensure you have packed everything you need to make the trip enjoyable for everyone. But there are lots of useful resources filled with great information to help you out.

Traveling solo is too dangerous for women</h2>\n<p>There's an entire genre of travel blogging that has grown out of the desire to crush the belief that solo travel is inherently dangerous for women. Not only is it outdated and sexist, but it's also incorrect. There are female solo travelers making their way to every corner of the globe, safely and expertly.</p>\n<p>That's not to say that there aren't precautions that solo female travelers should take to keep themselves safe. But they're exactly the same ones that apply to any kind of solo traveler, regardless of gender. Stay alert, do your research, don’t tell strangers where you’re staying, do let close friends and family know where you’re going, and consider joining a tour group if you’re uncomfortable on your own.

You can't work overseas</h2>\n<p>While it's not as simple as packing up, boarding a flight, and finding a suitable position in your chosen country, it's not impossible to work overseas. For 18–30-year-olds, there are working holiday visas that the U.S. government has set up with New Zealand, Ireland, South Korea, Singapore, and Australia that allow you to work overseas for up to two years with relatively few restrictions.</p>\n<p>If you don't qualify for one of those, then you can still work overseas as long as you have the correct visa. You should also be aware of U.S. tax regulations, meaning you'll likely still have to file returns. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-tax-myths-that-can-be-costly-for-expats?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Tax Myths That Can Be Costly for Expats</a>)</p>\n<h2>7. You have to have enough money for your whole trip before you leave</h2>\n<p>If you're planning on traveling for a long period of time, it can be daunting to save up the exact amount of money you need to cover your whole journey. But the truth is, you don't <em>have</em> to. It's entirely possible to set off with a limited amount of cash and earn money as you make your way around the world.</p>\n<p>There are countless ways to make money while you travel that are open to anyone, and if you have some skills that enable you to work remotely, then even better. From hospitality work to web design, there are lots of occupations you can do from anywhere in the world. Just make sure you've saved enough to get yourself started before hitting the road.

What about all those goals you wanted to achieve back in January? Since close to half of New Year's resolutions are abandoned after a month, there's a good chance you've forgotten yours by now.</p>\n<p>That's not to say your goals weren't grand. According to a YouGov poll, the top three resolutions in 2018 were to eat healthier, get more exercise, and save more money. Even though the year is half over, there's still plenty of time to check those boxes. Rather than store them away again until next January, let's harness the power of the summer and finish 2018 strong. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-financial-resolutions-you-can-conquer-before-new-years?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Financial Resolutions You Can Conquer Before New Year's</a>)</p>\n<p>However, doing the same thing and expecting different results is probably not the best approach. If you're serious about accomplishing your goals in the next three months, let's change tactics.</p>\n<h2>Break your goals into manageable chunks</h2>\n<p>The reason many of us lose focus is that our goals are very lofty. They're also not well defined. It can be hard to determine whether you've had success if your goal isn't quantifiable. And when we don't see instant results, our motivation can wane. Instead of focusing on that grand goal of weight loss or debt reduction, start with a smaller interim step.</p>\n<p>Set a specific goal to exercise three times this week or drink two extra glasses of water every day. Now your goal is measurable and a feeling of accomplishment can be achieved, in short order. As time goes on and you achieve the smaller goals, you're likely to sustain the adjusted healthy behavior.</p>\n<p>If you have a mountain of debt ahead of you, focus on <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-minute-finance-track-your-spending?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">tracking expenses</a> to see where your money is going, and getting a written budget in place before each pay period. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-steps-to-successful-budgeting?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Steps to Successful Budgeting</a>)</p>\n<p>These smaller tasks are manageable and easy to repeat regularly, but don't get ahead of yourself. Build up momentum during the days of summer so that you can turn this newfound focus into a positive long-term habit way before Christmas rolls around.

Whether that's an exercise partner, someone with the authority to pinch you anytime you reach for a cigarette, or a <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/want-to-win-at-personal-finance-start-a-money-club?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">money club</a> who meets regularly to discuss financial goals and priorities. We are not designed to live this life alone. So recruiting someone who can participate in your journey to goal completion can make all the difference.</p>\n<p>Opening up to someone about things we feel less confident about can be scary. It's hard to be vulnerable and let others in on the big secret that we don't have it all together. The good news is that people in your life already know you have flaws. We all do. Exchange support with your friends and family members because they might need help dusting off and resurrecting their New Year's resolutions, too.

Every single day.</p>\n<p>That's what former Navy SEAL, four-star admiral, and former chancellor at the University of Texas — William H. McRaven — attributes to his success. He told USA Today, \"There's a power behind making your bed every morning. Learn to do the little things well, learn to make your bed right. And that transcends into a lot of other things you do.\"</p>\n<p>His book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JY7l2e\" target=\"_blank\">Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life ... And Maybe the World</a>, discusses his theory of how starting your day off by accomplishing a doable task, like making your bed, sets the tone for the rest of your day. When you have a sense of accomplishment early on, you create a sense of momentum that will build and help you tackle more complex tasks with gusto.</p>\n<p>So give it a try. For the next three months, start your day by making your bed. See if that doesn't translate into significant progress toward completing those resolutions by Labor Day.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

So far, the spewing and oozing lava from Kilauea has destroyed hundreds of homes and obliterated a scenic bay once popular for snorkeling. Near the volcano, residents have evacuated, not just because of the lava itself, but also because of air filled with ash, hydrochloric acid, and even particles of volcanic glass.</p>\n<p>The destruction has many mainlanders wondering if they should avoid making Hawaiian vacation plans this summer. Clearly, if you had plans to tour the volcano, you'll have to change your itinerary, since most of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park is closed. However, most of the Big Island and the rest of the Hawaiian Islands remain safe.</p>\n<p>\"Visitors to Hawai'i can be assured that the volcanic activity is having no effect whatsoever on the other islands, O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i, LÄna'i, and Kaua'i,\" said Governor David Ige in a news release.

Here's why:</p>\n<h2>1. Air quality is safe everywhere that you're allowed to go</h2>\n<p>Before leaving on your trip, you can check the Environmental Protection Agency's <a href=\"https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_state&amp;stateid=12&amp;mapcenter=0&amp;tabs=0\" target=\"_blank\">AirNow website</a> or its interactive <a href=\"https://response.epa.gov/site/map_list.aspx?site_id=12766\" target=\"_blank\">Air Monitoring Viewer</a>, created to track air quality during the eruption. The combination of ash and fog is referred to as vog, and although it's usually not dangerous, it can ruin a sunset.</p>\n<p>\"Consider KÄ«lauea has been erupting for 35+ years — with ocean entries on several occasions. Vog is, therefore, not something new. However, with the current increased activity, [it] may be more visible than normal depending on wind strength and direction,\" the Hawaii Tourism Authority states.</p>\n<p>Currently, neither site indicates that any areas of the Big Island have pollutant levels that would cause the general public harm. If you have a pre-existing medical condition that makes you more sensitive to pollutants in the air, consult these sites with your doctor before deciding to go. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/15-ways-to-save-the-most-during-a-hawaii-vacation?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">15 Ways to Save Big During a Hawaii Vacation</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. The Big Island is huge and the lava area is small</h2>\n<p>It's certainly wise to look at a <a href=\"http://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/default/assets/File/news/06-04-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">map of the volcanic activity</a> to find out how far your chosen lodging is from the evacuation area. You can also check with your hotel or host. Officials are urging tourists not to try to get close enough to see the lava flow, for their own safety and to avoid further straining public safety resources.</p>\n<p>But chances are, you'll be staying miles away from the danger zone. Most hotels are in Kailua-Kona on the island's west coast or Hilo on the east coast, about 30 miles north of the lava area. The lava covers less than 10 square miles, or about 0.2 percent of the island.</p>\n<p>\"Let's put this into context,\" said Hawaii County Managing Director Wil Okabe in a news conference. \"All the islands in the Hawaiian chain can fit on the Big Island.\" He blamed the media, and confusion between the island of Hawaii and the state of Hawaii, for giving some mainlanders the impression that all of Hawaii is affected, instead of a tiny portion of one island.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. On the other islands, it's paradise as usual</h2>\n<p>The tourism board says no other islands in the state are affected. If you're staying in Waikiki, you'll be 200 miles away from the volcano; Kauai is more than 300 miles away. If you wouldn't cancel a trip to Las Vegas because of a natural disaster in Los Angeles, don't cancel a trip to another island because of what's happening on the Big Island.

Summer is one of the nicest times to visit Hawaii</h2>\n<p>While there is no <em>bad </em>time to visit Hawaii, many people (other than surfers) prefer June through September, when the ocean is warm and calmer than in winter months. There is also a lower chance of rain than in October, November, March, and April.</p>\n<h2>5. Hawaii needs you</h2>\n<p>Tourism is the largest single industry in Hawaii's economy, and on the Big Island, 30 percent of private sector workers are employed in tourism. The Big Island is already suffering due to the closure of the national park and because some cruise ships have stopped calling there. \"There are cancellations of vacations that affect the economy,\" said Okabe, who worried that mainlanders seeing volcanic eruption images in the media and on social networks were deciding not to go to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Officials say the effect on tourism revenue going forward will be difficult to predict, but the Island of Hawaii Visitors Bureau is projecting a potential 50 percent decline in business. Even more worrisome, some travel companies report that bookings to the entire state of Hawaii have declined, even though the other islands are not at all affected by the volcano.</p>\n<h2>6. You might benefit from smaller crowds on the Big Island</h2>\n<p>It's not clear whether volcano fears will lead to discounts for braver tourists this summer. But at the moment, July airfares from San Francisco to Kona, for example, look low — starting at $268 round-trip — compared to July averages in the $800 range, according to Kayak.com. Flights from the Bay Area to Honolulu can be had for as low as $258 in July.</p>\n<p>Whether or not you save money, you might enjoy fewer crowds, especially if you visit the Big Island. Fewer cruise ships calling at the ports of Kona and Hilo and less-full flights landing at the airports could mean more beach space for you — something to keep in mind especially if you're the type of traveler likely to be annoyed when a large ship pulls in.</p>\n<p>And if you think it's unseemly to head for an island enduring a natural disaster just to have a less-crowded holiday, consider all the people on the Big Island who rely on tourism to put food on their tables. They'll be happy you came.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

One of the main reasons is that tourist hubs like Playa Del Carmen and Cancun have largely been protected from the worst of the unrest.</p>\n<p>Recently, this has started to change and there have been gruesome and shocking incidents occurring in areas once thought unaffected. A bomb recently detonated on a passenger ferry from Playa Del Carmen that injured over 20 people. Cancun has seen various incidents of gun violence, including multiple murders on its white sand beaches and even a gunman firing at the beach from a jet ski. Another popular tourist area, Los Cabos in Baja California, has also felt the effects after a spate of grisly murders over the past year.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that it does have a serious crime problem, with more than 29,000 murders in 2017, Mexico is still generally very safe for visitors. There are other amazing destinations throughout Mexico that have not been hit by the same problems, and would make an excellent choice for a vacation. Here are five destinations in Mexico that are safer than Playa Del Carmen and Cancun at the moment.

Guanajuato</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The picturesque city of Guanajuato, which lies right in the center of Mexico, is still famed for its silver production in particular. At one point during the 18th century, it was one of the biggest producers of silver in the world, which meant it was flooded with wealth. This is clearly visible in the colonial mansions and ornate churches that you'll come across when wandering the narrow streets, many of which are so tight that cars can't navigate them.</p>\n<p>The city meanders its way right up into the surrounding mountains, which are dotted with a mish mash of vibrantly colored buildings. Among them you'll discover museums, theaters, plazas surrounded by outdoor cafes, and various interesting marketplaces. The atmosphere in Guanajuato is laid back, making it the perfect relaxing city break with a cultural leaning.</p>\n<h2>2. San CristÃ³bal de las Casas</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tucked away in the mountains of Chiapas in southern Mexico, San CristÃ³bal is relatively cold due to the altitude, and far away from either coast, so you won't be getting any beach time. However, what San CristÃ³bal does have in abundance is character, culture, and colorful colonial architecture, which combined with its rich history, make it one of the most fascinating towns in the country.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>The local population here has a uniquely high proportion of indigenous people from two main groups, the Tzotzil and the Tzelta. In the center, pastel colored buildings with red tile roofs line narrow cobbled streets, making it a picturesque place to explore. The mix of traditional and modern provides an interesting dynamic, with lively markets and street sellers offering handmade crafts. Those sit alongside bustling contemporary bars, cafes, and restaurants.</p>\n<h2>3. Puerto Vallarta</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Puerto Vallarta is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Mexico and has a sizable expat population, thanks to its modern amenities, lovely beaches, and a lively night life. But despite the similarities it shares with the likes of Cancun and Playa Del Carmen, it's actually got a completely different feel to it. There are two faces to Puerto Vallarta, the old and the new, with one boasting vast resorts and visitor-oriented attractions, the other filled with cobbled streets and the feel of a long-established Puebla.</p>\n<p>A wide and busy boardwalk runs from the heart of the old \"Romantic Zone\" along the seafront out toward the newer part of the city. Along its edges you'll find restaurants, bars, and shops selling everything from craft tequilas to souvenirs usually found in popular beach towns.

Oaxaca City</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Oaxaca City is currently enjoying something of a moment, having been billed by those in the know as Mexico's culinary epicenter. Regional delicacies hailing from this part of the country include the complicated and rich mole sauce; Tlayudas, which has been likened to a Mexican version of pizza; and chapulines (aka grasshoppers), which are widely used in various dishes. But there's more to Oaxaca than top notch noshes.</p>\n<p>The entire historic center of Oaxaca city has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site thanks to the historic monuments found within its meticulously planned boundaries. Despite the historic buildings, it's a modern city with cool cafes, trendy bars, and boutique hotels belying their antiquated facades. There are colorful markets filled with locally crafted goods, smoky food halls serving up delicious treats, and numerous festivals throughout the year during which the city explodes into colorful parties.

Tulum</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>This laid-back former hippy haven on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula is actually in Quintana Roo, the same state where both Playa Del Carmen and Cancun are located. However, it couldn't be more different. It's a beach town that isn't actually located on the edge of the coast, and lies a couple of miles inland with a large, green national park separating the two.</p>\n<p>The wide beaches nearby are fringed with boutique hotels, spa retreats, and easy going restaurants, so you can comfortably spend the day without heading into town. There are also some extremely well-preserved Mayan ruins inside the national park that provide spectacular views of the sea. The town itself is centered around a single main road that’s populated by traditional restaurants and bars.</p>\n<p>A bit further out, there are also spectacular cenotes, natural sinkholes formed when limestone bedrock collapses, exposing the ground water beneath. They’re a little slice of Eden. Gran Cenote is the most impressive, with turtles and colorful fish surrounding you as you snorkel.

There are so many demands on our finances that it helps to get creative in order to save a few bucks now and then. Whether it's getting out of costly social events, fending off salespeople, or even postponing charitable donations, we all tell white lies to avoid spending once in a while. And that's OK! Here are some of the most common ones I've used, and you can, too. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-10-biggest-lies-we-tell-ourselves-about-money?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The 10 Biggest Lies We Tell Ourselves About Money</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. \"I have a lot of expenses right now.\"</h2>\n<p>Unless you're swimming in money, this isn't even a lie. If you own a home and have a family, chances are, you do have many ongoing expenses to juggle. From your mortgage to school activities, it can all add up. If you are dealing with a salesperson or even just a friend asking for money, drop this line and you'll usually slide right out of this interaction. No one needs to know exactly how burdensome these expenses actually are. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-friend-types-that-can-hurt-your-finances?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Friend Types That Can Hurt Your Finances</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. \"I already have one.\"</h2>\n<p>If someone is trying to sell you a product or service, you may be able to make them go away by insisting that you have no need for what they're selling, even if that's not the case. Remember that the entire motivation of salespeople is to convince you that you need something. Your job, in turn, is to convince them that you don't.</p>\n<p><strong>Salesperson</strong>: \"Can I interest you in some new windows?\"</p>\n<p><strong>You</strong>: \"Thanks, but I just got new ones installed last year.\"</p>\n<p>Those windows may be 20 years old, and the salesperson may be able to tell that you're lying. But they are also unlikely to pressure you much further.</p>\n<h2>3. \"I have a scheduling conflict.\"</h2>\n<p>You may not have a conflict at all. It's likely that the only date you have is with your sofa and a few episodes of <em>The Good Wife</em>. But when you have no interest in attending that bachelorette party — that will likely end up costing you quite a bit of cold hard cash — this is how you can wiggle out of it. Your excuse can be anything. A cousin is visiting from out of state. You're pet-sitting for a neighbor. It doesn't matter. The key here is to save money, but also save the relationship by offering to meet the person later for a less expensive, one-on-one outing. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-get-out-of-social-obligations-that-break-your-budget?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Get Out of Social Obligations That Break Your Budget</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. \"I'm trying to get healthier.\"</h2>\n<p>You may not be trying to lose weight at all, but when you go out to eat, avoiding appetizers, drinks, and desserts is a good way to avoid unwanted costs as well as calories. These things can nearly double the price of your meal. The next time your friend or coworker tries to urge you to get those cheese sticks, the extra beer, or the chocolate cake, just tell them you're trying to eat healthier. In fact, you could say \"I'm trying to cut back.\" They don't need to know that it's the spending you're cutting back on.</p>\n<h2>5. \"My car is in the shop.\"</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you'll be asked to attend an event or outing that requires a long drive. This would involve miles on the car, gas, tolls, parking, and other expenses. However, if you tell folks that you're having car trouble, you may be able to avoid the event, or save the wear and tear on your car by getting a ride there. Of course, this doesn't mean you should simply accept transportation for free. You should be a decent person and offer to pay for gas money or parking. But you'll likely still come out better financially than if you drove yourself.

Dinner dates. Happy hours. Weddings. Little League Baseball banquets. No one wants to be around a sick person, so it's a great excuse. This is not a trick you can pull too often, or you'll be called out as a fraud. But every once in a while, it's convenient — and cost-effective — to feel some \"flu-like symptoms.\"</p>\n<h2>7. \"I've already donated this year.\"</h2>\n<p>I admit it: I've lied to a Girl Scout. She was in front of a store selling those famous cookies and she asked if I could purchase a box. \"No, thanks,\" I said. \"I bought some recently.\" This was a lie. Truth be told, I just didn't want to spend the money on cookies.</p>\n<p>When faced with solicitations from charities, it's often hard to say no. Sometimes, simply saying, \"I've already donated,\" can end the conversation. And it doesn't mean you can't go back and give once you're in a position to be more charitable.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

I try to keep the whole trip easy, from the planning, to the packing, to the sitting around the campfire. Of course, there are always trade-offs; you can spend more time preparing at home and put in less effort while on the trip, or vice versa. I like to find that sweet spot where work is minimized at every stage. Most of that has to do with relaxing some of the standards I adhere to back in civilization. Here's how I make family camping a cinch, and how you can, too!</p>\n<h2>1. Camp locally</h2>\n<p>When I was a kid, some of my happiest camping memories were made at a place in central Texas called Jellystone Park, less than an hour's drive from my house. In the mornings, my dad would drive to work, while my mom, brother, and I made jars of colored sand and took turns going down the waterslide at the pool.</p>\n<p>An eight-hour drive to a national park might be what you dream of when planning summer camping, but if your family is new at it, start with a state park or a private campground within an hour or two of home. This way, you'll be able to make a quick getaway if there's a storm or someone gets sick. You can even run home if you forget something. And if one parent can't take the whole time off work, you can do like my dad did and head to the office from the campground. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/camping-for-a-week-is-only-160-at-these-national-parks?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Camping for a Week Is Only $160 at These National Parks</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Camp near a town</h2>\n<p>Some families strap on backpacks and hike miles into the woods before setting up camp. That's admirable, but that ain't my family, at least at this point in our lives. Some of our most enjoyable camping trips have been on the outskirts of small towns, where we could walk or take a short drive to the store to stock up on necessities. This way, you won't have to plan all your meals in advance, and you don't have to bring as many coolers or as much ice, because you can buy a day's worth of groceries at a time.</p>\n<h2>3. Choose an easy campground and campsite</h2>\n<p>National forest campgrounds are cheap and often easy to book. It's even possible to camp in the wilderness, find your own water source, and just dig a hole for your bathroom needs. But if you have young children and little appetite for roughing it, look for a campground with an on-site store, showers, laundry, and even a pool or an indoor activity room. Kampgrounds of America (KOA) offers hundreds of private campground options that often provide these types of amenities. They cost a little more than public campgrounds, but KOAs delight my kids with their pancake breakfasts and mini-golf courses.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep an eye out for is whether you get to park right by your campsite or you have to carry your belongings from a parking lot to your site. If you have big kids this may not be a problem, but with toddlers or babies, it can be tough to ferry gear back and forth while keeping track of the little ones.</p>\n<p>Once the campground is chosen, you're not done. Study the campground map. (<a href=\"https://www.reserveamerica.com/outdoors/tent-camping.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ReserveAmerica</a> has maps for state parks and some other camping areas.) I like to pick sites near enough to the bathrooms that my kids can visit them alone. If water spigots or electric outlets are only available at some sites, I get one of those.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, if there is a lazy river or pond in the campground, you want to be far away from that because that's where the mosquitoes will be. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-simple-all-natural-bug-and-mosquito-repellents?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Simple All Natural Bug and Mosquito Repellents</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Lower your beauty standards</h2>\n<p>We don't pack that much in the way of beauty and hygiene products. A hairbrush and toothbrush for each kid, some toothpaste and hand towels to share, a beach/shower towel for each person, some soap and deodorant, and we're good to go. The most important personal care products you will bring are your sunscreen and bug spray.</p>\n<p>I don't bring stuff like shampoo, conditioner, makeup, or razors because I greatly lower my beauty standards in the woods. Showering or bathing every other day might be a firm rule at home, but while camping, I'm fine with my kids going the whole week without a shower if they want. I do, however, try to keep them brushing their teeth twice a day while camping. That has to do with health, not necessarily beauty.</p>\n<h2>5. Load up on baby wipes</h2>\n<p>Even if you no longer have babies, these things are clutch for camping. If you don't have access to a shower, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rScFJm\" target=\"_blank\">baby wipes</a> will be your hygiene go-to. Even at campgrounds with showers, wipes can come in handy for cleaning kids' grubby hands before a snack without hiking to the bathrooms. And if anyone gets car sick on the way there, you're ready for cleanup.</p>\n<h2>6. Bring all kinds of lighting</h2>\n<p>It's important to have a light source that doesn't need to be handheld. We have some tabletop lanterns with handles that can be hung inside the tent or from a clothesline as needed. Other handy lights are headlights and small <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Iw6O3k\" target=\"_blank\">LED flashlights</a> that can be slipped into pockets. These tend to disappear as a trip goes on, so buy lots of inexpensive lights and scatter them everywhere. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KxU2lF\" target=\"_blank\">Glow stick bracelets</a> or necklaces are also an affordable way to keep track of your kids in the dark.</p>\n<h2>7. Don't skimp on sleeping arrangements</h2>\n<p>After trying a number of camping products, I have become resigned to the fact that I was not built to rough it when it comes to sleeping. I can easily go a week without makeup, but I'm not happy if I try to sleep on a foam pad on the ground.</p>\n<p>Last summer, my family bought a big <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LbjSNr\" target=\"_blank\">Aerobed</a>, and we used the electrical outlet in our car to blow it up. I slept like a baby, and will bring it on every camping trip from now on. The only other thing that has given me serious comfort during camping is a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rQYYdu\" target=\"_blank\">hammock</a> — which is a lot cheaper and easier to pack, if you don't get too cold at night. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-air-mattresses?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The 5 Best Air Mattresses</a>)</p>\n<h2>8. Bring easy activities</h2>\n<p>My kids spend a lot of time playing in the woods and making up games involving their favorite trees, but everyone should have a book with them for quiet times, and bringing a board game is always a good idea.</p>\n<p>You can certainly implement a no-gadget rule, but if one of your kids is driving you crazy, you could always give them some tablet time alone in the tent or car.</p>\n<h2>9. Pack firemaking tools</h2>\n<p>I am a Girl Scout leader and I know how to construct a killer fire with a single match, but I'm also not above starting with a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Gv4CYk\" target=\"_blank\">Duraflame log</a> if I don't feel like working at it. A box of long stick matches is also helpful.</p>\n<h2>10. Bring all the baby gear you need</h2>\n<p>If you're camping with a baby, you already get a medal. You don't need to rough it by going without the things you rely on at home to keep baby safe and happy. I'm not saying you have to bring all 1,000 pieces of baby equipment in your house, but if you think you might need something and you have room in the car, don't deny yourself.</p>\n<p>Bringing a portable playpen could literally be a lifesaver, because an air mattress is not a safe surface for a baby to share. When we camped with our babies, I really appreciated having a safe place to stash the baby when I was cooking. Some <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IylIq6\" target=\"_blank\">portable playpens</a> even have changing table attachments, which is great because no one really wants you to change the baby on the picnic table.</p>\n<h2>11. Bring a huge tent</h2>\n<p>You'll already be dealing with more togetherness than anyone is used to while on a family trip. Don't feel bad about getting a huge tent so that sleeping bags don't have to be crowded up against each other. Or if the kids want their own tent, you can bring a small one just for them and let them set it up themselves.</p>\n<p>Bonus: You won't have to step over their mess in your own tent.</p>\n<h2>12. Pack with clear tubs</h2>\n<p>Clear plastic storage containers allow you to see everything you brought without having to unpack everything. They will keep everything dry and if the containers have a good latch, they’ll prevent animals from getting into anything. You can even stack them to make a temporary work surface at the campsite.</p>\n<p>When you're done with your trip, store your camping supplies in the same tubs, labeled, to make packing for the next trip a breeze.

Consider renting a specialty vehicle</h2>\n<p>The closest my family has gotten to renting an RV for camping is renting a Jucy — a minivan converted for camping use — and we loved it so much that the kids are begging to do it again this summer. The beauty of a converted van is that it drives like an ordinary passenger vehicle, but it has a little kitchen in the back with a mini-fridge, sink, drawers, and a stove. These things come with all your silverware and dishes. You also have a pop-up tent with a padded floor on the roof, allowing you to go camping with very little preparation.</p>\n<p>The Jucy made days at the beach during our trip a breeze, since we had cold food waiting for us in our fridge in the parking lot. I also loved stopping at a grocery store and loading my purchases directly into the fridge in the back of the van. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-easiest-ways-to-save-on-your-next-rv-camping-trip?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The Easiest Ways to Save on Your Next RV Camping Trip</a>)</p>\n<h2>14. Arrive before dark</h2>\n<p>Last summer, my family went on a camping trip and it was lovely — except the first night, when we arrived after sundown and struggled to put up two large tents on an unfamiliar, irregularly-shaped site.</p>\n<p>When you're on a weekend trip, it can be tempting to leave after work on a Friday to get the most camping time in, but if there's a chance that traffic or a delayed start might land you there after dark, think twice.</p>\n<p>You should also stop for a meal on the way to the site, so you don't have to worry about cooking while also setting up the tents the moment you arrive.</p>\n<h2>15. Make your kids help</h2>\n<p>After a long drive, your kids will want to run around and play. Let them do this, but only for five minutes. Then put them to work. Everyone above the age of infant should have a job when you pull into the campsite. Little kids can set up their own camp chairs and hold onto the bag of stakes while the tent is going up. At ages eight, 11, and 14, my kids can now set up the tent with little adult help.</p>\n<h2>16. Put up clothes lines</h2>\n<p>Having somewhere off the ground to hang everything, from damp towels to clothing to sleeping bags that need airing out, is really handy. It's also a great place to clip a lantern after dark to add more lighting to your campsite.</p>\n<h2>17. Don't try to be a fancy chef</h2>\n<p>I like to keep camping meals really simple. At home, we make pancakes from scratch, but at the campground, I've been known to bring the kind of pancakes you spray out of a can. I get precooked meats wherever possible because I've experienced the kind of mess you can make if a package of raw ground beef leaks in a cooler. And canned soup and boxed macaroni and cheese are lunchtime favorites.</p>\n<p>Simple also means fewer dishes to wash. I confess that I resort to a lot of individual packaging when camping. I've purchased those individual boxes of cereal, which the kids <em>love</em>, and cases of granola bars and canned sparkling water are my best friends.</p>\n<p>If you want to avoid waste, there are a lot of ways to prepackage things using upcycling. Don't want to buy ready-made pancake batter? You can make it at home and package it in a ketchup bottle for the same ease with less waste. Instead of individually packaged granola bars, you can make granola at home and store it in an empty coffee creamer bottle for easy snacking.</p>\n<p>Pre-measuring ingredients such as flour, spices, etc., allows you to both throw together meals more easily and pack less, since you only bring as much as you need of each ingredient.</p>\n<p>Or you can go all out at home and cook the whole dish, then freeze it to reheat at the campground. My mom would often make a big pot of chili or spaghetti sauce before we went camping. If you have leftovers already stored in your fridge, you're all set to grab and go. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-tips-for-camping-cooking?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Tips for Camping Cooking</a>)</p>\n<h2>18. Bring your cooking gadgets — or not</h2>\n<p>If you like to pack less, try to get a campsite with a grill or a grate that goes down over the fire and bring a bag of charcoal. On one trip last summer when we forgot to pack our camp stove, we managed to cook all kinds of meals, including bratwurst, eggs, and grilled cheese, right over the fire with little hassle.</p>\n<p>But if you have a campsite with electrical hookups — or even a converter to plug into your car for electricity — you can use all your gadgets to make cooking easier at the campground. Folks are bringing their <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2s1ih3T\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Pots</a> camping, and I may just try it this summer. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/12-instant-pot-recipes-that-will-save-you-money?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">12 Instant Pot Recipes That Will Save You Money</a>)</p>\n<h2>19. Try to get everything dry before packing up</h2>\n<p>Sweep or use a portable vacuum cleaner on the inside of the tent and wipe any dew off the sides before packing it up. If you can't get it clean and dry — like if it's pouring out during your departure — you'll have to set the tent up again in your yard when you get home in order to prevent mold from forming. To make your next trip easy, double check for moisture or any odors in the bins, your tent bag, and sleeping bags before storing them.</p>\n<p>For me, the exception to this is dishes. Although I like to keep a dedicated bin of cooking utensils and dishes for camping, I do run them through the dishwasher when I get home before repacking them. I wash the dishes at camp before heading home, but I don't pay too much attention to how they get thrown in the bin since I know I'll be redoing it in the comfort of my kitchen.</p>\n<h2>20. Keep all your camping gear in the same place</h2>\n<p>Stack all those clear bins full of clean, dry, ready-to-go camping gear in the same area of your garage or crawl space, so that next time, you can throw them in the car and go. If you need to replace or repair something, do it now instead of putting it off until you're getting ready for your next trip. If you make a habit of having everything ready before you store it, you won't have to waste time going through everything before the next trip.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Here are five questions to ask yourself before deciding on private school for your child. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-times-you-should-choose-private-school-over-public?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Times You Should Choose Private School Over Public</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Can I afford it?</h2>\n<p>Before you even consider how great a certain school is, you have to know whether you can afford it or not. Will you have to get another job? Will sending your child to this school put unnecessary financial stress on your family? What will you sacrifice to send your child to private school?</p>\n<p>The national average private school tuition is about $10,302 per year, according to Private School Review, but of course this cost varies drastically depending on the area. For example, the average price of a private school in Iowa is almost $5,000, but over $16,000 in New York. Most private high schools cost more than private elementary schools, as well, so your cost will go up if you keep your child enrolled throughout their school life.</p>\n<p>Yes, this school might be an amazing opportunity for your child, but is the cost truly worth it? I'm not talking about just the sticker price of the school. You also have to weigh the cost of working longer hours and spending less time with your family in order to make it work. Really consider if you can afford the school and the sacrifices you might have to make along with it.

What are the hidden costs?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the costs of sending your child to a private school don't stop at the monthly tuition bill. There could be several other hidden costs as well, such as the cost of uniforms, expensive textbooks, fundraising fees, field trips, and other special events. Of course, don't forget about sports, elective classes, or after school activities. If the tuition bill is already tipping your budget into the negative, then the extra fees might be too much for your family to handle. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-save-money-on-kids-activities?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Save Money on Kids' Activities</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. How does it compare to the other schools nearby?</h2>\n<p>There must be a reason why you're considering a private school rather than a public one, so make a list of those reasons. Is it because of safety? A particular sport your child plays? Is it because of your religion? Or perhaps because private schools tend to look better on college applications?</p>\n<p>Once you have those written down, find out all you can about the private school versus the public schools in your area. For example, if safety is a main priority for you, find out how the private school maintains a safer campus than the other schools. What safety protocols do they have in place? How many incidents have there been in the past five years?</p>\n<p>It's important to dig deeper into these issues because you might discover that behind the high price tag and fancy test scores, the private school you had your eye on isn't much safer or better at getting students accepted to top colleges than you thought. On the other hand, the private school you're interested in might have a huge lead over other schools in athletics or academics, which makes the tuition easier to justify.</p>\n<h2>4. What will this school do for my child?</h2>\n<p>No one knows your child better than you do, so evaluate potential schools for what they will offer your child. Don't get distracted by impressive stats the school might advertise, like having an unbeatable mathletes team or having the highest number of full college scholarships for basketball players. Make a list of your child's strengths and weaknesses and discover how the school can support both. For example, if your child is naturally talented in theater arts but struggles in math, will this school give him or her unique opportunities to act and learn more about theater? Does the school offer special classes or tutoring to strengthen math skills, or will they be thrown into an advanced math class and expected to stay afloat?</p>\n<h2>5. What is student life like?</h2>\n<p>School is more than just academics; it's the place where students learn to socialize and create strong friendships. A school that boasts high test scores, but has miserable students is not a healthy environment for anyone. When evaluating the school, ask how the school gets the students involved in their local community. Are the students encouraged to partake in activities that help others outside of the school?</p>\n<p>You also want to learn how much time is given for breaks and socializing and how often the teachers encourage group projects and working together in the classroom. Most importantly, how does the school deal with bullying and other social behavior issues?</p>\n<p>There is truly no right or wrong answer when it comes to choosing a private school or a public school for your child. You know your kid best, and you know what's the best for your family.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

What's the first thing that comes to mind? Maybe you enjoyed teaching your kids about new places, new cultures, or the history of the destination you visited. Or perhaps you were just tickled to give your kids some undivided attention without work or life getting in the way.</p>\n<p>What you may not have considered, is the fact that any kind of travel can be a learning opportunity — even if it's not too far from home. This is particularly true when it comes to lessons about money, because travel requires so many financial decisions.</p>\n<p>If you're angling to broaden your children's perspectives on money, keep an eye out for learning opportunities that may be less than obvious. Here are some lessons your kids can pick up no matter where you go.</p>\n<h2>1. The importance of budgeting and tracking spending</h2>\n<p>No matter how careful you are when you set your travel budget, it's easy to let your spending get out of hand. You're away from home and on a different schedule, and you're probably around food, souvenirs, and constant temptations to spend.</p>\n<p>That's why a family vacation may be the perfect time to introduce your kids to the concept of tracking your daily spending — it's one of the best ways to stay within your travel budget. To get your kids into this mindset, you just need to set a daily spending limit, then clue your kids into how it works. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-fool-proof-ways-to-stay-within-your-travel-budget?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Fool-Proof Ways to Stay Within Your Travel Budget</a>)</p>\n<p>My husband and I typically take our kids on a three- or four-week trip to Europe every summer. On these trips, we set a daily spending limit to cover food, souvenirs, and snacks. While the spending limit depends on where we are, it's usually enough to cover one meal \"out\" per day and a daily splurge like gelato or candy. We eat the rest of our meals in our condo or hotel.</p>\n<p>This really annoys my kids (ages six and nine) sometimes, but I explain that we have a budget for the entire trip and the only way to stay within our budget is by breaking it down by the day. They don't always like when we're in our hotel eating sandwiches for dinner, but they do understand why we do it.</p>\n<h2>2. How credit works</h2>\n<p>Tanner Calais, founder of Cruzely.com, says cruises are another opportune time to teach kids about spending and credit, since cruise lines have you charge all your expenses to a key card tied to your account. The system is similar to credit cards in that you're using \"invisible money\" to buy things, and you pay your bill at the end of the cruise. \"This is a great opportunity to introduce kids to the power of credit cards and how they work,\" says Calais.</p>\n<p>For instance, it can be tough to track your spending when you don't see it because you're using a card. By forcing the kids to watch you keep track of your daily purchases with a notepad or your smartphone, you can help them see how spending can add up over time. \"It's also not free money simply because cash doesn't come out of your wallet when you buy something,\" he says.

Money doesn't grow on trees</h2>\n<p>Here's another lesson kids need to learn: Money is a finite resource.</p>\n<p>Eileen Gunn, founder of the blog Families Go Travel, says this is one lesson her child has learned by bringing her own souvenir money on vacation. Having her 10-year-old daughter bring her own stash of cash to spend has helped her learn that \"you can't have everything you want,\" says Gunn.</p>\n<p>For example, if she has $20 to spend on a trip and sees something she wants for $20, she has to decide whether she wants the item badly enough to spend her entire budget on it. She also has to make peace with the fact that she won't be able to afford anything else she wants for the duration of the trip.</p>\n<p>Gunn says she has occasionally loaned her daughter money when she was desperate to have another souvenir, \"but it has to be something really worthwhile.\" Also, Gunn makes her repay the loan as soon as they get home from their trip. The entire process \"makes her a more discerning consumer,\" says Gunn.</p>\n<h2>4. The power of compound interest</h2>\n<p>Travel blogger Kevin Payne, founder of Family Money Adventure, offers the perfect example of how you don't have to travel far to teach your kids about money and finance. Recently, part of his family had an epic staycation in their hometown of Cleveland, Ohio while his two older kids were in New York City. They visited the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, including its Learning Center and Money Museum.</p>\n<p>Payne says he and his children learned many money lessons during the trip, including the history of bartering and why money is a better system of exchange. But that's not all.</p>\n<p>\"I think the biggest lesson they learned was the importance of saving money and the role of interest,\" he says. The museum accomplishes this goal via a staircase to its second level that illustrates the power of compound interest on every step.</p>\n<p>\"Each step represented a year more of interest so the kids could see how much money they would end up with after a 20-year period of saving,\" says Payne. \"It was such a great way to illustrate how quickly savings can add up.\" (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-investing-lessons-you-must-teach-your-kids?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Investing Lessons You Must Teach Your Kids</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. The power of negotiation</h2>\n<p>In some countries, local markets provide a powerful lesson in bargaining. Travel blogger Shannon O'Donnell, founder of A Little Adrift, has had periodic custody of her niece, and she has used that time to travel with her and teach her about money.</p>\n<p>O'Donnell says that, while they were in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar, her then 11-year-old niece learned to critically evaluate the cost of something she wanted, plus how to respectfully bargain if she wanted a better deal.</p>\n<p>\"She would use this skill at the local markets if she wanted to buy a souvenir and became quite good at disarming them with a smile as she politely asked for better deals,\" says O'Donnell. \"Overall, by learning that some cultures bargain for better deals, it has allowed her to consider the value of her purchases and how she spends her money even when back home in the states.\"</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. How you can save money while still having fun</h2>\n<p>While travel isn't typically cheap, there are still plenty of ways to save. Blogger Lee Huffman of Dads Who Travel says he uses travel to teach his kids that you can save money on some aspects of your trip and still have a blast.</p>\n<p>One strategy he uses to impart this message is booking accommodations that have some sort of kitchen. This allows them to save money on food by buying groceries. \"For example, on our last trip to Orlando, we stayed at a timeshare property that offered a mini-kitchen with a fridge, microwave, and two-burner stove,\" says Huffman.</p>\n<p>They still have a boatload of fun on their trips, but he goes out of his way to explain to his kids why dining out for every meal would make each trip cost considerably more.</p>\n<h2>7. Be grateful for what you have</h2>\n<p>Corinne McDermott, founder of Have Baby Will Travel, says travel has helped her kids understand how fortunate they are. During her family's frequent trips to the Caribbean, they often talk about how people's homes are different and how the children appear to have fewer belongings. Yet, the people they meet are still happy and thriving.</p>\n<p>\"We've been fortunate to meet and socialize with many locals on our travels, and they work hard and are as proud of their homes and families as we are of ours,\" says McDermott. \"Occasionally we all need reminders to be grateful for all that we have, no matter how it compares to others next door or across the world.\"</p>\n<h2>8. Being able to travel means parents have to work</h2>\n<p>Family finance writer Catherine Alford agrees that travel offers an endless number of opportunities to teach your kids about money. However, the most important lesson she wants to teach her kids is that, in order to travel, Mom and Dad have to work. \"I've been teaching them the connection between hard work and purchases since they were babies,\" she says.</p>\n<p>When her children were two years old, Alford and her husband took them on a monthlong European vacation where they visited five different countries. Since she works remotely as a blogger and freelance writer, Alford had to work throughout the trip. \"I kept reminding them that we were able to travel because Mommy was working,\" she says.</p>\n<h2>9. Experiences are better than things</h2>\n<p>For many families, prioritizing travel means they need to cut back on other kinds of purchases in their everyday lives. Those are often sacrifices they're happy to make. Shannon Austin, senior communications director at the Center for Financial Services Innovation says one of the biggest lessons her family has learned from travel is that they can have amazing experiences if they maintain a reasonable lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Austin and her children had the opportunity to live in Germany for three years when her oldest was six and her youngest was two. Once they moved abroad, she says she told her kids that they planned to \"live small so they can experience big.\" Over the three years they spent in Germany, they took 36 trips to destinations including Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Austria.</p>\n<p>\"My oldest delights in noticing some flowers that remind her of the plants growing over terraces in Ronda, Spain; my youngest recalls riding donkeys in Santorini. They remember filling water bottles on the roadside at a waterfall in Norway; they remember hikes in the Franconian part of Germany,\" says Austin. These memories are priceless, she says, but they were only possible because her family prioritized travel instead of \"stuff.\" (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-reasons-you-should-splurge-on-experiences-not-things?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Reasons You Should Splurge on Experiences, Not Things</a>)</p>\n<h2>10. How currency exchange works</h2>\n<p>Travel can also help teach your kids how money works around the world. Tracey Carisch, author of the upcoming memoir <em>Excess Baggage: One Family's Around-the-World Search for Balance, </em>says her children gained firsthand experience in how currency works when they traveled nomadically for 18 months.</p>\n<p>Carisch says her oldest child began to understand how different types of currency work when they arrived in South Africa from Ethiopia. They found a currency exchange booth at the airport and went to exchange their remaining Ethiopian birr for South African rand. As she was talking to the cashier, she mentioned to her daughter that they made a little money on the trip due to the favorable exchange rate.</p>\n<p>\"My daughter's curiosity was piqued and she started peppering me with questions,\" says Carisch. \"Within five minutes, she understood the concept behind currency trading and cross rates. She researched it on Forex and came up with a home-school module for herself based on reading currency pairs and calculating spreads.\"</p>\n<p>Carisch also says her child \"doesn't even like math.\" This just goes to show how powerful travel can be when it comes to learning about money and math. You can learn and forget almost anything in a classroom, but real world experiences teach lessons that last a lifetime.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

While some issues are unavoidable (the hotel room isn't ready, the rental car breaks down, someone gets sick), there are others that can be avoided if you pay close attention to travel advisories. These warnings are given days, or even weeks, in advance, and can save you time, money, and in extreme cases, can even mean life or death.</p>\n<h2>1. Extreme weather</h2>\n<p>Weather is one of the easiest vacation issues to predict. Advances in meteorological science mean that weather experts can predict major problems with a reliable degree of accuracy. That means hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, torrential rain, extreme heat, blizzards, and even dangerous hail are literally on the radar for meteorologists.</p>\n<p>If they warn you of these weather conditions before you are set to travel anywhere, rethink your plans. Extreme weather shifts like this can ground planes, cause car crashes, wipe out roads and buildings, and lead to serious injury and death. Don't mess with mother nature; you'll lose.

Civil unrest and political upheaval</h2>\n<p>Most of us are fortunate enough to live in a land of (relative) peace. It's easy to forget that in some parts of the world, citizens are in a fight for justice, and their lives, on a daily basis. If you are not up on the latest news from around the world, you could be in for a rude awakening when you get to your destination. For example, the U.S. government is currently advising you to reconsider travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela, and Sudan, among others, due primarily to crime and civil unrest in these regions.</p>\n<p>If you must travel to these areas, perhaps for work or a family emergency, you should exercise extreme caution and take the necessary steps to stay safe when you arrive. Consider a local trusted guide or escort who can advise you on where to go and, more importantly, where to avoid.

Health and disease</h2>\n<p>While modern medicine safeguards us and helps us recover from all kinds of communicable diseases, you cannot take any risks when traveling abroad. That's why you should always check with the <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) before taking any kind of trip.</p>\n<p>Current notices at the time of this writing include an outbreak of malaria and listeriosis in South Africa, and malaria and yellow fever in Brazil. And since June of 2017, over 2,000 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been identified in multiple countries in the Arabian Peninsula. You can get additional vaccines before you travel, or if you are really concerned, change your plans to a different location. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-ways-to-stay-healthy-on-vacation?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Ways to Avoid Getting Seriously Sick on Vacation</a>)</p>\n<h2>4. Terrorism</h2>\n<p>Since September 11, 2001, terror attacks have increased substantially in some parts of the world. The State Department currently has Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen on the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html\" target=\"_blank\">Do Not Travel list</a>, primarily due to incidents of terrorism.</p>\n<p>Many other countries get a Reconsider Travel notice for terrorism dangers, including Pakistan, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Lebanon. These terrorism warnings are constantly updated, so if you know you may be traveling to a part of the world that has been home to terrorist activity, check the list and consider your alternatives.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>5. Crime and personal safety</h2>\n<p>While the two often go hand in hand, there are some distinctions to be made here. For example, many countries have a crime rate far in excess of anything you've experienced in the United States, and as such, you will not be prepared for the dangers without first researching the area. El Salvador, Burundi, Guatemala, Nigeria, and Mauritania are all flagged right now for problems with crime. Take the following precautions in places known to have a high crime rate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Consider hotels that offer secure parking, doormen, and a dedicated and professional security staff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Request security escorts, available for tourist groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be aware of your surroundings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid walking or driving at night.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not use public ATMs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While crime can certainly result in physical danger, there is another kind of personal safety issue you need to be aware of. It's known as \"risk of arrest and detention,\" and happens in places that have a volatile relationship with the U.S. North Korea is a prime example, and if you do not have special validation from the Department of State to travel in, or through, North Korea, you may find yourself in deep trouble.</p>\n<h2>6. Airline issues</h2>\n<p>Perhaps one of the most obvious, but often overlooked, travel warnings come from the airlines themselves. When we think of a travel advisory, we think of weather issues, health and disease, crime, and civil unrest. But one surefire way that your vacation can come to a grinding halt is when the airline has an issue. Anything from a computer system going down, to problems with labor negotiations and strikes, or mechanical malfunctions and serious delays, can put a serious dent in your plans.</p>\n<p>Every airline has its own alert page, so if you know which airline you plan on taking, check out that alert page regularly.</p>\n<h2>7. War</h2>\n<p>We live in turbulent political times. While some wars have been raging for decades, others could break out at the drop of a hat. If you're not following politics closely, you should take notice if the region you are traveling to is about to go to war (or is actually at war and you didn't even know it). The most infamous places right now are Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur, Myanmar, Nigeria, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, and the Central African Republic.</p>\n<p>Other danger zones closer to home are some regions of Mexico. Since 2006, the Mexican drug war has had over 106,000 casualties, with almost 15,000 of those coming in 2017 alone. The Mexican states of Colima, Guerrero<strong>, </strong>MichoacÃ¡n, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas are all currently on the Do Not Travel list due to crime. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-affordable-destinations-that-are-safer-than-you-think?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Affordable Destinations That Are Safer Than You Think</a>)</p>\n<h2>8. Geological disasters</h2>\n<p>This is a broad term, because you could easily put extreme weather into this category. But in this instance, it's reserved for natural disasters. For example, when Iceland's volcano EyjafjallajÃ¶kull blew in 2010, massive clouds of ash made travel impossible for millions of people. An earthquake warning, or the threat of a volcanic eruption or a landslide, should be taken very seriously. If you're planning on traveling to a place known for these kinds of natural disasters, and there's evidence that you could be caught in something horrific, change your plans.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Their baby wasn't even a year old and hadn't yet discovered he could walk, Wang says. What was the worst that could happen?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, their baby refused to sleep the entire journey, and Wang had to walk the length of the plane to keep him busy. In the meantime, he \"just about lost his mind.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was a nightmare,\" he said, and an extremely long one. If he had to do things over, Wang says he would have probably just stayed home.</p>\n<p>Skipping the entire thing may sound good if you're facing a long flight with a baby or several kids, but it's not always feasible. Maybe you're desperate for a real vacation or need to travel to see family. Whatever the reason, flying with babies is sometimes inevitable.</p>\n<p>Many family travel pros say your flight doesn't have to be miserable. There are strategies parents can use to make the experience relatively painless. If you know what to prepare for — and what to avoid — flying with an infant can even be seamless.</p>\n<h2>1. Consider buying your baby an airline seat</h2>\n<p>While most airlines let children ages two and under share a seat with a parent (sometimes for a small fee), you do have the option to buy them a separate seat. That's one thing Wang, who writes about personal finance and frugality at Wallet Hacks, wishes he had done differently.</p>\n<p>\"We would've considered spending the extra money to buy a seat so we could use a baby seat that he was familiar with and stood a chance at sleeping in,\" he says. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/why-southwest-airlines-is-the-best-domestic-airline-for-families?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Why Southwest Airlines is the Best Domestic Airline for Families</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Bring out the screens</h2>\n<p>Another big fail the Wangs admit to is not bringing along any screens or digital entertainment. Yes, even a baby under the age of one may be entertained watching a movie or cartoon — at least for a while. Even if you have a \"no screens\" policy at home, a long flight is a good reason to reconsider — at least for the day and for your time in the airport.</p>\n<p>\"It's not good to put such a young kid in front of a screen, but for that special circumstance, I would've buckled,\" Wang says. \"Since it never occurred to us, we didn't have anything prepared so we couldn't even give in.\"</p>\n<p>Corinne McDermott, founder of the blog Have Baby Will Travel, agrees that technology is a must if your baby is old enough to care. \"The tablet is your friend,\" she says.</p>\n<h2>3. Plan your flights around the baby's sleep schedule</h2>\n<p>McDermott says another important consideration is what time you travel. And if you're able to pick among several different flights, you should tailor your schedule around your baby's natural rhythms.</p>\n<p>\"Try to book your flight for a time your baby is likely to sleep,\" she says. With this strategy, you may let your baby squeeze in their nap while you're in the air.</p>\n<p>You could even consider a red-eye flight that takes place overnight. But if you opt for this option, you should try to follow your baby's regular sleep schedule as much as possible. For example, have your baby change into pajamas, brush their teeth, and read them their normal bedtime stories.</p>\n<p>If this doesn't work, you should \"try to book for when your baby will be most cheerful,\" she says. If your baby is always crabby first thing in the morning but good by 10 a.m., for example, keep that in mind when you're booking your trip.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Bring stuff to do</h2>\n<p>While this might seem obvious, bringing stuff to keep your baby entertained is a stellar idea — even if you expect them to sleep. McDermott suggests stashing a few toys and books out of sight before your trip, then bringing them out on the plane as a surprise. \"Your baby or toddler will be happy to see old favorites while en route,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Depending on the age of your baby, old-school fun like crayons, blank sheets of paper, and a travel Etch-a-Sketch could be lifesavers. If your baby is a small infant, bring their favorite mobile, a boatload of pacifiers, board books, and whatever else your baby loves.</p>\n<h2>5. Dress for success</h2>\n<p>Since the temperature on planes can be so variable, you need to think about how you dress your baby before you leave for your trip, says writer and editor Melissa Mayer of Why Not Let's Go. Frequent flyers know that some planes tend to be hot while others can be overly cool. \"Babies are temperature-sensitive and you don't want to be unprepared,\" she says.</p>\n<p>The solution? \"Dress your baby in layers and have a blanket in your carry-on so you can cool down or warm up your baby if and when necessary,\" says Mayer. The blanket will also help provide comfort and block the light when it's time to sleep.</p>\n<h2>6. Make the airport experience as easy as possible</h2>\n<p>While flying with your baby is a big part of the travel experience, you'll also need to spend a few hours in the airport each way. This part of the trip can be important since it can set the tone for the rest of your journey.</p>\n<p>Sarah Hirsch, founder of the blog Well-Traveled Kids, says she believes upgrading to services like TSA Precheck and <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-sign-up-for-global-entry?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Global Entry</a> can be worth it to avoid long lines at the airport. While you can pay for these benefits outright, keep in mind that there are several travel <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/best-credit-cards-that-offer-tsa-pre-check-and-global-entry-reimbursement?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit cards that offer TSA Precheck and Global Entry</a> as a cardholder perk.</p>\n<p>Also, be prepared for TSA screening. \"If you are boarding with liquids for the baby, put those on the belt before your luggage so they can be tested while you are getting your bags and stroller through security,\" says Hirsch.</p>\n<p>Also, take your stroller in the airport and gate-check it before boarding the plane. This is better than checking the stroller with your luggage since you'll still have access to it while you're waiting in the terminal for boarding.</p>\n<h2>7. Bring a fully stocked diaper bag</h2>\n<p>Last but not least, make sure you are fully prepared for any typical day with your baby. This includes bringing extra clothes, bibs, diapers, diaper cream, and wipes. \"I've been stuck on the runway for hours and happy I had extra supplies,\" says Hirsch.</p>\n<p>You should also be prepared to change a diaper or two on the plane. This may have to go down in your seat since not all planes have a changing table. Also remember that diapers can and do fail — often at the worst times. \"My infant always had a blow out when the plane took off,\" says Hirsch. As the saying goes, better safe than sorry.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Everything we're told about raising children revolves around the importance of routine and stability — two things you're likely to lose on a travel day.</p>\n<p>It can be challenging just trying to get the kids off to school in the morning, let alone taking them to a new country on a one-week vacation. Travel days will likely be your biggest challenge because once you arrive at your hotel or resort, you can mostly relax and enjoy. But you can mitigate most of the stress and chaos of long travel days by packing the right items and following a few simple rules.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> (See also: </span><a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-wisely-choose-your-next-travel-destination?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 13px;\">How to Wisely Choose Your Next Travel Destination</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">)</span></p>\n<h2>1. Choose the right destinations</h2>\n<p>The right destinations for you and your family will depend on a lot of factors, as there's no one-size-fits-all destination. While you don't need to rule out certain countries because you're traveling with kids, you do need to take your children's ages into consideration to find locations that will be the most suitable for kids.</p>\n<p>Daily adventures like long hikes may be more difficult with younger children, whereas many teenagers will need things to keep them stimulated. A good way to ensure everyone is happy is to get them involved in the decision-making. Older kids can do their own research on the internet, while younger children can be given a number of options to choose from after explaining what each has to offer.

Book family-friendly accommodations</h2>\n<p>Booking the right accommodation is vital to making traveling the world with your family a success. Those with kids, particularly younger ones, will attest that a good night's sleep can mean the difference between a fun day and a nightmare. Your options are obviously more limited than when you're solo traveling or with friends, with many hostels, guesthouses, and even some hotels operating a no-children policy.</p>\n<p>Your best options are to stay in hotel suites, or to rent full apartments through sites like Airbnb. Privacy is a must, and it's great to have your own space to relax in, and for the kids to have room to play and run around. You can narrow the hotel options on search engines by using the sort function to filter by family-friendly properties. Airbnb also enables you to find entire houses or apartments that are family-friendly. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-hotel-booking-websites-can-save-you-money-and-headaches?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How Hotel Booking Websites Can Save You Money</a>)</p>\n<h2>3. Pack light</h2>\n<p>What to pack is often at the forefront of parents' minds when they make the decision to travel with their family. Just the thought of trying to condense all of the gear — particularly associated with younger children — down to a manageable amount can be daunting. Things like strollers, car seats, and carriers all take up huge amounts of space, and that's before toys, clothes, and everything else they might need. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-ways-families-can-travel-like-minimalists?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Ways Families Can Travel Like Minimalists</a>)</p>\n<p>Packing as light as possible will make moving around far easier, and will potentially save your family lots of money in excess baggage fees. As soon as your kids are old enough to carry a backpack or wheel a suitcase, it's a good idea to get them involved in the packing stage as well. They'll soon come to appreciate the importance of packing light, and will enjoy being involved in the process.</p>\n<p>Generally, anything that's an absolute necessity for children will be available pretty much anywhere you go, but here are a few things that you can pack to ensure that your travel day will run as smoothly as possible.</p>\n<h3>Baby wipes</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of germs on travel days and your little ones are going to be more susceptible to catching something on the road. Bring a few sanitizer or baby wipes and wipe down airplane seats, seat belts, handles and any surfaces your children may touch during the trip.</p>\n<h3>Comfort toy</h3>\n<p>Most children have some kind of toy, blanket, or pacifier that calms them down. Bring it! These simple items can be life savers.</p>\n<h3>Tablet</h3>\n<p>Load it up with all of your kid's favorite music, movies, and TV shows and let them play and watch to their heart's content. Keep in mind that while on buses and in cars, you may want to limit exposure as it can lead to motion sickness.</p>\n<h3>Child-sized luggage</h3>\n<p>Kids like to feel like adults from time to time, and by having their own carry-on luggage or backpack, not only will they feel like Mom and Dad, but they'll be able to carry some of their own things and access them when they feel like it.</p>\n<h3>Headphones</h3>\n<p>Even if you don't have a tablet or smartphone for your kids, you can usually plug in the headphones and let them watch the entertainment provided on planes and buses.</p>\n<h3>Lots of water</h3>\n<p>This is something you don't want to run out of. Bring plenty of water and have your kids carry their own bottle, either clipped to their person or onto their luggage.</p>\n<h3>Trash bags</h3>\n<p>With wet wipes, snacks, water bottles, and tissue, you're likely to have a lot of trash on travel days. Bring bags to easily store it all until you can ditch it in a proper trash bin.</p>\n<h3>Healthy snacks</h3>\n<p>Loading your kids up on sugar on travel days is just asking for trouble. Instead, pack low-sugar, healthy snacks like crackers, nuts, cheese sticks, Cheerios, and pretzels.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Sunscreen</h3>\n<p>Even if you're planning to be in the airport for most of your travel day, you never know if you'll be by the bus window on the tarmac or waiting in line to board the plane. Bring lots of sunscreen and keep everyone from getting burned. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-sunscreens?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The 5 Best Sunscreens</a>)</p>\n<h3>Camera</h3>\n<p>Keep your camera somewhere that you can easily grab it at a moment's notice. Funny things happen on travel days and it's always adorable to take a photograph of your kid boarding a plane or looking out the plane window.</p>\n<h2>4. Slow it down</h2>\n<p>Though it's completely possible to move from place to place relatively quickly with a family, if you have the luxury of an extended vacation, it's a much better idea to take it slowly and spend a good amount of time in each destination. This is important for practical reasons, like not having the hassle of unpacking and repacking every few days, but it will also allow you to create routines and provide a level of stability in each place.</p>\n<p>Slow travel will allow you the option of booking longer-term accommodation, which is likely to bring the cost down. Rather than staying in hotel suites, you'll be able to book houses or apartments via sites like Airbnb, where hosts regularly offer long-stay discounts, or directly with local landlords.</p>\n<p>Moving quickly can begin to feel like a whirlwind of activity and leave no time for your children to build attachments to places. In contrast, spending a few weeks or months in one spot will allow your kids to get familiar with the people and places at the location and give them a deeper connection.

Plan ahead when flying with babies</h2>\n<p>Generally, you won't pay for airline tickets for children under two years of age who sit in your lap, at least on domestic flights. However, you do still have to inform the airline when booking that you're traveling with a small child. You may also want to reserve a baby cot or bassinet with the airline in advance, or arrive early for those that operate on a first come, first served basis. It's generally free, but check with each airline for their individual policies.</p>\n<h2>6. Sign the kids up for frequent flyer miles</h2>\n<p>On many airlines, frequent flyer programs have no age minimum, meaning kids can earn points, as well as adults. They will have to have their own frequent flyer account in order to start accumulating the points, but that's just a matter of filling out a simple form. Pooling family members' points can be a quick way to multiply your earnings. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-frequent-flyer-miles?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Everything You Need to Know About Frequent Flyer Miles</a>)</p>\n<h2>7. Get a travel-friendly stroller</h2>\n<p>Nothing is more annoying than fumbling around with a bulky stroller while trying to check into a flight. You may want to consider an fold-up umbrella-style stroller or a lightweight, portable travel stroller. There are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2K6UkQ7\" target=\"_blank\">plenty on Amazon</a> to choose from, and most stores that carry strollers will also carry umbrella strollers and other lighter-weight options.</p>\n<h2>8. Make sure kids sit middle or window</h2>\n<p>The aisle seat is a surprisingly dangerous place for little ones. With heavy metal carts and people whizzing by, I've seen many a tiny finger squished by an unsuspecting passenger, who feels awful afterward.</p>\n<p>To avoid a lot of tears and potentially a broken finger, always try to seat your little ones in away from the aisle.</p>\n<h2>9. Have a \"what if I get lost?\" plan</h2>\n<p>This one seems obvious, but in the rush and chaos of getting everyone to the airport on time, many parents forget to form an emergency plan with their children on travel days. Whenever you arrive in a new place, let your child know which people are security or police and who to go to in the event of splitting up.</p>\n<p>Also, choose a safe and secure meeting point that you can all head to if for some reason you can't find one another. If your kids are a little older, make sure everyone has their phone volume on loud and set to vibrate so that you can call each other if anyone gets lost.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

If data breaches from big stores like Target and Home Depot several years ago didn't convince you of this fact, the 2017 Equifax data breach, which may have released the sensitive data of up to 145 million consumers, probably helped you realize how much peril your personal information could be in.</p>\n<p>If you've seen ads for credit monitoring services like LifeLock or Identity Guard, you may have wondered if signing up is worth it. You may have also heard about credit freezes and fraud alerts and wondered how those work. Before you take any steps to protect your credit and your identity, here's what you should know. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/dont-panic-do-this-if-your-identity-gets-stolen?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Don't Panic. Do This Instead If Your Identity Gets Stolen</a>)</p>\n<h2>The difference between credit monitoring, credit freezes, and fraud alerts</h2>\n<p>During the Equifax data breach, consumers' names, Social Security numbers, addresses, and, in some cases, credit card numbers were accessed by hackers. To control damages after the breach, Equifax created a special website where you could enter your information and <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/eligibility/eligibility.html\" target=\"_blank\">find out if you were affected by the Equifax breach</a>. It also began offering a year of free credit monitoring and other identity theft services to all U.S. consumers, whether their information was accessed during the data breach or not.</p>\n<p>In addition to taking advantage of credit monitoring, Equifax and consumer advocates suggested consumers consider several other steps to protect their credit right away: freezing their credit reports and placing a fraud alert on their reports.</p>\n<p>But what's the difference between these options? While each service has the same goal of protecting your identity and your credit, they all work differently and some may be better for some consumers than others.</p>\n<h3>Credit monitoring</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, credit monitoring is a service people pay for. With LifeLock, for example, you can pay a monthly fee to have the company continually check for fraud or threats to your financial accounts and credit reports. Other credit monitoring services work similarly, although they may offer different features.</p>\n<h3>Credit freeze</h3>\n<p>With a <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-freeze-your-credit?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">credit freeze</a>, you usually pay up to $10 per credit reporting agency to make your credit report inaccessible to lenders, thereby making it impossible for hackers and scammers to open new accounts in your name. Note that you usually also pay a fee every time you want to unfreeze your credit. For now, credit freezes and unfreezes are free with Equifax.</p>\n<h3>Fraud alerts</h3>\n<p>If you don't want to freeze your credit completely, you can place three different types of fraud alerts on your credit report instead. <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-get-a-free-fraud-alert-on-your-credit-report?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">Fraud alerts</a> are free, and they require lenders to verify your identity before issuing new credit in your name. As the <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs#difference\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Trade Commission</a> notes, options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Initial fraud alert: This type of fraud alert is best for someone whose identity hasn't been stolen yet. It protects your credit from unverified access for up to 90 days.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Extended fraud alert: An extended fraud alert protects victims of identity theft for up to seven years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Active duty military alert: This alert protects active duty service members from identity theft for up to one year while they are on deployment.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Should you pay for credit monitoring?</h2>\n<p>Whether you should pay for credit monitoring depends on your situation. Gerri Detweiler, education director for Nav, a company that makes tools for managing business credit, says that while there are more opportunities than ever to monitor your credit for free, there are times when paying for a more comprehensive service could be advantageous. \"The monitoring on these platforms can be more robust,\" she says.</p>\n<p>If you know that you will not take the time to monitor your credit accounts yourself, or you just want the peace of mind of knowing someone else is doing it for you, then paying for a subscription service may be worth it.</p>\n<p>Freezing your credit report can also make sense, says Detweiler. But if you're doing it to prevent identity theft, you need to know the drawbacks. \"It can be a hassle when you go to apply for credit, insurance, or even try to get a new cellphone,\" says Detweiler, mostly because you will have to unfreeze your credit report any time you want to apply for new credit. That can get costly.</p>\n<p>Detweiler says she also worries that credit freezes create a false sense of security. While a freeze can prevent someone from opening new accounts in your name, it can't prevent hackers from using your existing accounts fraudulently or stealing your information.</p>\n<p>As far as fraud alerts go, Detweiler chose this option when she was a victim of identity theft in 2017. While a credit freeze locks down your new credit, fraud alerts allow creditors to access your credit report as long as they are able to verify your identity. For this reason, fraud alerts may be a better option for someone who opens new credit regularly and still wants some protection against identity theft.</p>\n<h2>Other ways to keep your credit safe</h2>\n<p>If you are preparing for a crucial loan like a mortgage, new auto loan, or small business loan, for example, you want to make sure your credit is as solid as possible, says Detweiler. That's because lower credit scores may mean you won't get approved for the loan or you'll pay more in interest charges.</p>\n<p>Plus, you'll want to keep your identity and personal information safe from hackers and scammers no matter what. If your identity is stolen, it can take months or even years to get the situation cleared up.</p>\n<p>Detweiler says you should take advantage of the fact that you can get a free copy of your credit report from the three credit reporting agencies — Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion — once per year at <a href=\"http://www.annualcreditreport.com\" target=\"_blank\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. By accessing your full credit report regularly, you can check for errors or fraudulent activity and report them immediately if you find them. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-read-a-credit-report?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Read a Credit Report</a>)</p>\n<p>There are also plenty of places where you can get a free credit score. Many credit card issuers give out <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/best-credit-cards-that-offer-free-credit-scores?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">free credit scores</a>. Other free services such as Credit Karma give you an estimate of your credit score year-round and set up notifications to let you know when a new account is opened in your name.</p>\n<p>Trevor Buxton, Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) and assistant vice president of fraud prevention at PNC Bank also suggests the following actions to keep your credit safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Keep a close eye on your bank accounts. \"If you notice unauthorized activity on your account, immediately call the number on the back of your debit, ATM, or credit card, or stop by your local branch,\" says Buxton.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sign up for alerts on your accounts. Many banks let you set up your credit and debit accounts so you're notified any time a purchase is made.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spread your free credit reports over the course of a year. Since you can get a free report from the three credit reporting agencies once per year, Buxton suggests spreading those out by accessing one free report every four months.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notify credit reporting agencies of any false reporting. If you find any errors on your credit report, notify the credit reporting agency in question and dispute the information right away. You can find out more about how to dispute errors on your credit report on <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0151-disputing-errors-credit-reports\" target=\"_blank\">the FTC website</a>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Cardboard boxes and any containers you have sitting around the house will suffice for sorting items. But professional organizers know that there are certain containers, shelves, and gadgets that can make the job of decluttering easier. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-smart-ways-to-keep-your-entire-life-clutter-free?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Smart Ways to Keep Your Entire Life Clutter-Free</a>)</p>\n<p>Besides, having a shiny new toy or two just might incentivize you to finally get to work on your decluttering project. Here are some top storage picks from the pros.</p>\n<h2>1. Paper sorter for container lids</h2>\n<p>I'm one of those cooks who saves every scrap of leftovers, no matter how small; so of course I have a million plastic and glass storage containers in my kitchen — and <em>of</em> <em>course</em> I have trouble corralling all those lids and keeping them in order. I was intrigued when I read on the <a href=\"http://bneatobar.com/the-tupperware-search-party/\" target=\"_blank\">Bneato Bar blog</a> that a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2I8Nn0j\" target=\"_blank\">paper sorter</a> — normally found in offices — could be helpful the kitchen for keeping container lids accessible and visible in a drawer when placed on its side. I'll try it!</p>\n<h2>2. Lazy Susan</h2>\n<p>Raise your hand if you think we need a gender-neutral term for this incredibly useful device. Maybe I'll just start calling it a Lazy Sam. At any rate, put these <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2I3rUKj\" target=\"_blank\">rotating trays</a> in your pantry and cabinets.</p>\n<p>\"Instead of letting the oils and vinegars that fall to the back disappear, it keeps everything accessible because it spins!\" says professional organizer and blogger Tova Weinstock, aka Tidy Tova.</p>\n<h2>3. Linus clear open storage bins</h2>\n<p>These open-topped, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rtHeWj\" target=\"_blank\">stackable bins with built-in handles</a> by InterDesign are marketed as a bathroom organizer, but founder of Gotham Organizers, Lisa Zaslow, recommends them for every room and closet in the house.</p>\n<p>\"They come in a variety of sizes and make it super easy to group similar things together — one of the golden rules of organizing,\" Zaslow says. \"Because they're sturdy and easy to clean, they're particularly great for things that can spill or are sticky.\"</p>\n<p>Weinstock also recommends clear Linus bins, especially for the pantry.</p>\n<p>\"I love these for keeping like-items contained (think: baking supplies) so you know where things are and don't end up buying multiples,\" Weinstock says.</p>\n<h2>4. 3-tiered mesh tray</h2>\n<p>Founder of Chicago-based organizing service Organizing With You, Inc., Pooja Naik recommends a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Iv7OrI\" target=\"_blank\">tiered mesh tray</a> for taming desktop clutter by organizing papers that need attention into categories. It may seem obvious, but, she explains, it helps you get that first step of organizing done, clearing the surface, which then gives you more workspace to tackle the next task.</p>\n<h2>5. NEET zippered cable tie</h2>\n<p>With a video-gamer husband and three children who all have their own personal devices, I live in a cable nightmare. Charging cords dangle and sprawl all over my house, making areas that should be calm — like my bedroom — feel chaotic.</p>\n<p>Professional organizer and blogger Cary Prince found a product that just might solve my problem at the National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO) conference (yes, that's a thing). These <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KKyRh7\" target=\"_blank\">zippered cable ties by NEET</a> are like little coats that zip around your cables, from skinny earbud wires to fat bunches of coaxial cables.</p>\n<p>At home, they can gather together messes of cables and keep them from getting coated with dust. In a purse or suitcase, they provide a convenient way to wrap up and contain cords so they don't get tangled.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>6. MOS magnetic cable organizer</h2>\n<p>Another idea for reining in cord chaos is this chic <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2I8URAF\" target=\"_blank\">magnetic cable organizer</a> by MOS, which can be mounted on a wall or placed on a desktop. It comes with magnetic blue cable clips to attach cables to its surface. Founder and president of Mindful Decluttering &amp; Organizing, Pam Holland, included this item in her list of favorite organizing products, explaining, \"This attractive magnetic pad makes it easy to keep those unruly electronic cables in one place and untangled.\" (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-easy-ways-to-declutter-your-digital-life?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 Easy Ways to Declutter Your Digital Life</a>)</p>\n<h2>7. Mesh stacking shoe shelves</h2>\n<p>More than one organizer I spoke with agreed that shoe racks or shelves are a must for preventing pileups. Zaslow swears by this <a href=\"https://www.containerstore.com/s/white-mesh-stackable-shoe-shelf/d?productId=10015028&amp;q=mesh%20shoe%20shelf\" target=\"_blank\">white mesh shoe shelf</a> from The Container Store.</p>\n<p>\"The mesh keeps heels from falling through the shelf, and you can quickly stack them up to store many pairs of shoes in a small 'footprint' — no tools needed. They are super minimal so you barely see them, but they're really strong, unlike some other flimsy shoe shelves,\" Zaslow says.</p>\n<h2>8. Command hooks</h2>\n<p>Lack of adequate hooks for hanging things is often a frustration for me, especially since I'm not handy with a drill. Zaslow solves this problem by using easy-to-apply <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2woHY49\" target=\"_blank\">Command hooks</a>, which come in a variety of sizes.</p>\n<p>\"There endless ways to use them: hang mops and brooms inside of a closet, create a spot for kids' backpacks near the front door, hang your blow dryer on the side of your vanity, or store oven mitts inside the door of a low cabinet near the stove,\" Zaslow says.</p>\n<h2>9. Stackable shelf organizer</h2>\n<p>Ideally, your kitchen would have shelves at the perfect heights to store all of your dishes and glasses, with no big gaps of wasted space between shelves. But why wait until you have the ideal kitchen before you start organizing, when you can maximize the space in the cupboards you have now? Holland recommends doing that with this <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2K4hWEZ\" target=\"_blank\">DecoBros product</a>, not just inside cupboards but also on countertops.</p>\n<p>\"I prefer these to the white wire ones commonly used as they are more stable and things don't slip through the cracks,\" Holland writes.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

These days, more and more people are using the web to research destinations, plan itineraries, and book their own hotels.</p>\n<p>The freedom to research independently is a good thing, but there's also a problem: The American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA) reports that 55 million hotel booking scams are perpetrated against unsuspecting consumers each year.</p>\n<p>The organization acknowledges that the internet has offered great conveniences in the travel space, but says hotel booking scams continue popping up all the time. Rogue third-party online booking sites imitate legitimate hotel websites, taking advantage of the huge volume of online travel searches. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/this-airbnb-scam-will-ruin-your-vacation-and-your-budget?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">This Airbnb Scam Will Ruin Your Vacation — and Your Budget</a>)</p>\n<h2>The anatomy of a hotel booking scam</h2>\n<p>According to the AHLA, many hotel booking scams are set up so consumers don't even know they've been tricked. Most of the time, it starts with a hotel scam website being created and promoted so that it shows up in internet search engines right alongside legitimate hotel websites and third-party booking sites.</p>\n<p>\"These rogue sites trick consumers by mirroring the look and feel of the actual hotel website — using copyrighted images, trademarked logos, and many times, even similar URLs — to take consumers for a ride,\" writes the AHLA in a report about online booking scams.</p>\n<p>From there, the fraud committed can take on several different forms. The fraudulent website may steal the victim's money completely without making a hotel reservation on their behalf. Or it might charge the consumer an inflated rate that includes a giant commission the consumer shouldn't have to pay.</p>\n<p>At the very least, you may miss out on hotel loyalty points or perks you thought you were going to receive if you believed you were making a reservation directly with a hotel.</p>\n<h2>How to avoid hotel booking scams</h2>\n<p>The AHLA has partnered with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to raise awareness about hotel booking scams with the goal of protecting consumers. According to Beverly Baskin, CEO of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, certain types of consumers are especially at risk for these scams, including travelers ages 55 and up and members of the military. Baskin says that travel and vacation scams cost the average victim around $847.</p>\n<p>If you're eager to ensure your travel plans aren't ruined by thieves, consider these tips from the BBB and the AHLA:</p>\n<h3>Book directly with the source</h3>\n<p>Before you book a hotel stay online, make sure you are booking on the hotel's website. While a lookalike hotel website may have the hotel's name in their URL, double check the website address to endure it's not a third-party website trying to steal a hotel's identity.</p>\n<p>If you're booking with a large hotel chain, one way to do this is to visit the chain's website and make your reservation from there. If you're booking the Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik Hotel in Croatia, for example, go to Hilton.com and book your reservation on the main hotel website.</p>\n<p>If you do an internet search for \"Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik,\" you will see several lookalike sites like this one:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You should avoid these third-party imposters at all costs.</p>\n<h3>Use reputable third-party websites</h3>\n<p>It's OK to use third-party websites like Expedia, Travelocity, and Priceline. Legitimate <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-hotel-booking-websites-can-save-you-money-and-headaches?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hotel booking sites can save you money</a> and headaches. But you should beware of thirty-party booking sites you have never heard of. The BBB says you should never trust a website just because it looks legitimate. Take the extra step to check the company out with BBB.org and read online reviews before you book.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Take advantage of hotel loyalty programs</h3>\n<p>If you're someone who likes staying with the big hotel chains (e.g. Hilton, Marriott, IHG Rewards, etc.), it makes sense to sign up for the related <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/breakdown-of-benefits-and-value-of-the-best-hotel-rewards-programs-and-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hotel loyalty program</a>. These programs are free to join and they typically offer the lowest rates to loyalty members who book direct.</p>\n<p>Not only will you have a secure loyalty account you can make your bookings through, but hotel loyalty programs let you earn points for free hotel stays, <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/easy-ways-to-get-elite-status-for-free-hotel-upgrades?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hotel room upgrades</a>, and more. Some <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-best-credit-cards-for-hotel-deals-and-rewards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hotel credit cards</a> also let you earn large <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-best-credit-cards-with-sign-up-bonuses-for-hotel-stays?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">sign-up bonuses for hotel rewards programs</a>, which make it easier for you to rack up enough points for free rooms quickly.

If you find you are the victim of a travel scam or hotel booking scam where they kept your money without making a hotel reservation, you can <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-awesome-credit-card-tricks-that-will-save-you-money?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">ask for a \"chargeback\"</a> on your account and get a refund. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-win-a-fraud-dispute-with-your-credit-card-company?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Win a Fraud Dispute With Your Credit Card Company</a>)</p>\n<h3>Keep your eyes wide open</h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to avoid becoming the victim of a travel scam is to know what to look for. The BBB says you should avoid conducting internet searches for broad terms like \"best travel deals\" or \"cheapest rates\" since those type of searches tend to bring out the worst offenders among lookalike travel websites.</p>\n<p>If something seems off, the BBB says you should call the hotel and ask plenty of questions.</p>\n<h3>Make sure you know the hotel's refund policy</h3>\n<p>The BBB says you should read all the fine print before you agree to a hotel charge being placed on your credit card. Will you need to pay upfront, for example? Or will your card be charged upon arrival? Is the hotel booking refundable if you need to cancel for any reason?</p>\n<p>While some big hotel chains and legitimate third-party booking websites offer discounts for non-refundable fares, it's more common for hotels to use your credit card to secure the reservation but wait to charge the rate until your hotel stay is completed. Hotel cancellation policies vary by chain, however, so make sure you know the policy ahead of time.</p>\n<h3>Plan ahead</h3>\n<p>Last but not least, you may get the best price on your hotel stay and other travel arrangements if you book far in advance. Planning ahead will also give you time to compare options, research hotel booking websites, and lock in a good rate.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a last-minute, hasty search for a hotel may put you at greater risk for encountering a scam and losing money.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

But very few people actually have the means to take the plunge and make it happen. One of the most common reasons for staying put is not having enough money to satisfy that wanderlust. However, most of us have a ready-made travel fund at our disposal in the numerous possessions that we own.</p>\n<p>One of the quickest and easiest methods of committing to a life of travel and being able to afford it without years of saving is to sell everything you own. Here's how to do it. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/make-money-and-declutter-by-selling-these-5-unlikely-treasures?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Make Money and Declutter by Selling These 5 Unlikely Treasures</a>)</p>\n<h2>Get in the right frame of mind</h2>\n<p>Selling everything you own might feel nothing short of terrifying, never mind the fact that you'll be setting off on a journey into the unknown immediately after. For most people, the thought of getting rid of things that they've had for years and formed emotional attachments to can cause serious distress.</p>\n<p>However, if you're ready to embark on this adventure, you'll need to get into the mindset of valuing experiences over physical possessions. A great method for doing this is to find a way to remind yourself of exactly why you're doing this and the amazing memories it's going to pay for. Selling that beloved car that you'd dreamed about owning for years? That's potentially six months' worth of accommodation costs paid for. Getting rid of a childhood toy that was a birthday gift from your parents and has now become a collectors' item? That could pay for a delicious meal out.</p>\n<p>You can find a million reasons to set aside stuff that you don't want to sell, but once you start down that path, it's difficult to stop. Mentally detaching yourself from your possessions can be gut-wrenching, but once it's done, you'll feel free of all that material baggage and ready for a new chapter.

Go through your digital and hard-copy photos from previous trips, or read an inspirational travel blog every day. Whatever it is, find a way to maintain that sightseeing excitement when you start feeling blue.

Make an inventory list for everything you have, either in a notepad, or in a spreadsheet so it's easy to search and edit. This will also come in handy for tracking what's sold and for how much.</p>\n<p>Once everything is on the inventory list, price each item by checking eBay and Craigslist to see how much similar items are going for. This will take some time, but will be worth it to ensure you're getting market value and not letting things go too cheaply or expecting way too much.</p>\n<h2>Set a date</h2>\n<p>Once your items are priced and ready to go, it's important to quit procrastinating and just start selling. The best way to jolt yourself into action is to set a date when you're going to have everything sold by. The longer you wait to start, the easier it is to talk yourself out of selling certain items, and the harder it will be to actually let everything go.</p>\n<p>Be realistic when you're setting the date and take into account how long it's going to take to put your possessions up for sale, plus the amount of time it may take before they’re actually sold. Not everything will be snapped up right away, and even some extremely valuable items may take a long time to get rid of. Allow yourself at least a few weeks, but ideally, a number of months to get everything sold.</p>\n<p>You can also set a target for how much you want to make from selling everything and break it down into a weekly target. This way you can work toward it in increments and maintain your focus by just doing a little bit each day.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Use the right platforms</h2>\n<p>To maximize the amount of money you're recouping for each item, it's important to choose the right platform to sell it on. Though it may take more time to do it this way, it will ensure you receive the best value for your belongings.</p>\n<h3>eBay</h3>\n<p>This site is great for collectibles or other small items that have a decent value. For these items, it's best to use the auction function in the hope that you spark a bidding war between interested parties, driving the price up.</p>\n<p>Don't be tempted to just throw a bad picture up there and a two-word description of the item. The more effort you put in, the more attractive you can make things look. Put a bit of time into writing brand names, captions, and taking photos that show items in their best light.

That’s why Craigslist is a great option for these item. Think furniture and bulky items like TVs.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> When buyers come to collect, take the opportunity to show them your other stuff and ask if they're on the lookout for anything else. You may be surprised at how many extra sales you make this way.</p>\n<h3>Yard sales</h3>\n<p>Remember, one person's junk is another person's treasure. Because of this, even the odd bits and pieces that you may not think would sell might earn you a few dollars or more in the right setting. Yard and garage sales are great for these kinds of items, because in my experience, they're often attended by people looking for unusual objects.

She made doll houses, and was interested in objects that would be suitable to furnish them, and was willing to pay for items that probably wouldn't have sold elsewhere.</p>\n<h3>Facebook Marketplace</h3>\n<p>Facebook Marketplace can be a great tool for selling specialist items, and items to people who live nearby. You have to have a Facebook account in order to use this part of the platform, and you can include photos, the price you're offering the item for, and any additional details. Interested buyers can contact you via direct message to inquire if the item is still available, or ask questions. You don't need to be Facebook friends in order to connect with potential buyers.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Credit expert John Ulzheimer says it's just like teaching your teenager how to operate a car, but in a controlled environment. \"Nobody would just let a teen hop in a car and drive,\" says Ulzheimer, who formerly worked with Equifax and FICO. \"And nobody should just let their kid get a card on their own someday without some teaching by the parents.\"</p>\n<p>Yet, that is exactly what many people do. The problem is, for a teen, a credit card may seem \"no different from using a gift card or some other stored-value card,\" says Ulzheimer. And that can be dangerous. If they charge more than they can afford to repay, they might wind up dealing with years of debt and regret.</p>\n<p>The reality is that your child will need credit to borrow money one day. If they don't build a solid credit history during high school or college, they may start their adult lives at a disadvantage. \"Helping your teenager build their credit can make their life easier in the future when they go to purchase a big-ticket item on a line of credit, like a vehicle or home,\" says Gina McKague, president and CEO of retirement planning firm McKague Financial.</p>\n<p>And while some financial experts like Dave Ramsey insist that nobody needs a credit score to get by in life, many argue that thinking is outdated. The reality is, <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-life-is-better-with-good-credit?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">good credit improves your life significantly</a>. \"Not only is establishing credit vital for obtaining something significant like a loan, but as more and more vendors exclusively accept payments via credit cards or even smartphones, it can be necessary just for buying lunch,\" says Jeff Motske, financial planner and CEO of Trilogy Financial in Huntington Beach, California.</p>\n<p>Besides lenders, everyone from car insurance companies, to landlords, to employers can ask for modified versions of your credit report. They can influence your ability to get a job, an apartment, or good car insurance rates. If those aren't reasons enough to get your teen on the right track with responsible credit use, what is?</p>\n<h2>How to get your teenager a credit card</h2>\n<p>Ulzheimer says there are several ways to know if your child is ready to learn about credit. If they're already using debit cards, prepaid cards, or their phone to make purchases with your credit card information, then they're probably ready to get a credit card with your help, he says. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/8-best-sites-to-help-your-kids-learn-about-money?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Websites to Help Your Kids Learn About Money</a>)</p>\n<p>Still not sure? A teenager's senior year in high school is often a good time to start. \"That way, they're as mature as possible while still living under your roof,\" notes Ulzheimer.</p>\n<p>Once your kid is primed and ready, the best way to introduce them to credit is by <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-reasons-to-add-your-teen-as-an-authorized-user-on-your-credit-card?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">adding them as an authorized user</a> to your own credit card account. Doing so comes with several advantages, including the fact that your own positive credit movements will be reported to your teenager's credit report. Not only that, but you will receive the bill, so you can keep tabs on their activity. Just be aware that you and you alone are responsible for repaying every charge your teenager makes.</p>\n<p>Ulzheimer suggests teaching your kids to use credit cards only for purchases they were going to make anyway, such as gas or movies. If they have a job, you can even require that they make payments from their own money, he says.</p>\n<p>This should be easy to do even though you're the one receiving the bill. When your statement arrives in the mail or via email, simply tally up your child's purchases and let them know what they owe. Ideally, they will also keep a record of what they paid for with credit and have the money saved to pay their share of the bill — just like in the real world.</p>\n<p>And if you're worried your teen will fall into some bad credit habits right away, Ulzheimer suggests setting up text alerts so you know exactly when the card is being used. This way, \"you can make sure they're not using the card outside the boundaries you set,\" he says.

For example, explain what expenses the card should be used for, how long the funds on the card should last, and what criteria would cause you to revoke the prepaid card.</p>\n<p>Many prepaid debit cards, such as the Current Card, are geared toward teens. The Current Card runs on the Visa system, so it's accepted at most merchants. Like any other prepaid debit card, you have to load funds into the account before it can be used. But the Current Card also offers enhanced features that help kids budget their money, save for a rainy day, and donate to charity. Parents are able to manage and oversee the teen's purchases with a mobile app and add money to their accounts instantly.</p>\n<p>A regular debit card tied to a bank account can also be a good way to get the ball rolling, or it can be a transition tool between a prepaid card and a credit card. You may even want to link it to the child's own bank account, so they can only use money that's given to them or that they earn from chores or a job.</p>\n<p>Eventually, however, you want to introduce them to credit cards by adding them as an authorized user to your account. Ideally, you'll want to do this before they leave the nest and wind up dabbling with credit on their own. \"Be sure to establish a new set of ground rules with the new card, including the familial and financial consequences of not following those rules,\" advises Motske.</p>\n<p>The idea of giving your teenager a credit card may be the stuff of nightmares. But it could be even scarier to imagine them learning about credit through the school of hard knocks — by racking up a huge mountain of debt or ruining their credit score by not paying their bills.

Some of the most memorable headlines in the past few years have even gone viral, giving the animals in question an instant dose of fame. There was the woman who caused a stir trying to board a flight with a fully grown peacock at Newark Airport, and a pig named Hobie who was ejected after boarding for defecating on the plane.</p>\n<p>But behind all the bizarre headlines, there's a lingering concern of how to safely travel on a plane with your pet. There are a number of possibilities for animal lovers and their companions to travel together, though the specifics tend to vary from airline to airline, and your destination will have a big impact on it, too. Here's what you need to know before heading to the airport with Fido.</p>\n<h2>Check with the airline before booking</h2>\n<p>Many carriers, particularly on flights departing and arriving within the U.S. and its overseas territories, do allow you to bring animals onboard with you. Domesticated dogs and cats (and sometimes small birds) will be allowed on, though there is usually an extra fee attached, and there's a limit on the total number of pets per flight. For example, American Airlines charges $125 per carry-on pet. Larger animals will typically need to be boarded with cargo underneath the plane.</p>\n<p>Each airline has its own rules about the size, weight, and breed of animal you are permitted to travel with, as well as specific guidelines on how they are to be transported. Because of this, it's best to check directly with your intended airline before booking the flight. Generally, they must be small enough to fit underneath your seat in a carrier that's large enough for them to turn around in.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Certify your pet as an Emotional Support Animal</h2>\n<p>If taking your pet onboard with you is a medical requirement — for example, if you've been diagnosed with depression or anxiety — then you should consider getting it classified as an Emotional Support Animal (ESA). If this is the case, and the animal in question helps alleviate symptoms, then you can legitimately get your pet designated as your ESA. Keep in mind, this is not a quick fix or workaround and should only be used in genuine circumstances.</p>\n<p>In order to have your pet certified as an ESA, you'll need to get a letter from a mental health professional. This letter will need to detail your condition, testify to the fact that you are a patient under their care, include the name of your pet, and explain how the pet helps you. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-make-your-pet-an-official-emotional-support-animal?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Make Your Pet an Official Emotional Support Animal</a>)</p>\n<p>Several sites allow you to purchase these kinds of letters online for a fee, with very little process and without ever meeting a medical professional, but many of these services are not legitimate and the letter they provide will not be deemed valid.</p>\n<p>Once you have secured this letter, you're good to go and need to carry it with you to show to the airline crew before boarding. Letters are valid for a year, so they need to be dated when they are issued.</p>\n<h2>Head to the airport early</h2>\n<p>The most important step to take when flying with a pet is to contact the airline well in advance to inform them of your plans. This applies whether it's an ESA or not, so you can avoid any nasty surprises that may prevent you from being able to catch your flight.</p>\n<p>On the day of travel, you should arrive early to the airport to allow yourself time to sort out any issues that may arise. Your airline may want to check paperwork; examine, weigh, and measure the pet; or check that the crate or carry case meets their specifications. Animal spots on planes are also often provided on a first come first serve basis, and while it's unlikely that there will be several other pets onboard, it's not worth taking the risk. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/23-tips-for-traveling-with-pets?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">23 Tips for Traveling With Pets</a>)</p>\n<h2>What you need to know about pets flying with cargo</h2>\n<p>Flying in the cargo hold is the obvious alternative to let you fly with your pet, but it's one that many people try to avoid. It can be stressful for the dogs, and there have been numerous incidences of animals being lost, injured due to turbulence, or dying due to extreme temperature fluctuations. However, many planes that carry pets keep their luggage compartment pressurized and climate-controlled, as a way to keep pets in the cargo hold more comfortable.</p>\n<p>It's also not free, and the fee attached might be more than the fee to take the pet onboard with you. For larger dogs, you may have no other choice than to put them in the cargo hold. But for smaller pets, it’s a good idea to check fees before you decide which way to take your pet.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Millennials, in particular, are making money in ways that weren't possible just five or 10 years ago. Entire professions have sprung up that allow savvy entrepreneurs to cash in while actually working less than if they had a regular full-time job.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of articles out there claiming to show you how easy it is to make millions with very little work. I want to stress that generally this simply isn't the case, and there are no legitimate \"get rich quick schemes\" on the internet. All of these jobs, even the ones that will eventually provide you with passive income, take a lot of work and dedication to get right, especially at the start.</p>\n<p>However, with a bit of know-how and a lot of dedication, it's possible to break free from a life chained to your cubicle working 60 hours a week. Millennials have been at the forefront of the latest developments on the internet, and are continually inventing new ways to earn a living through it. Here are six ways millennials are working less and earning more.</p>\n<h2>1. Cryptocurrency</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency has been constantly in the news recently, with analysts and skeptics regularly predicting that it's on the verge of suffering a huge crash. Despite all the doom and gloom surrounding it, and some recent volatility, there are still plenty of people making money from it. There are also many different ways that people can use <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/what-is-cryptocurrency-anyway?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrency</a> to make money, meaning it's a versatile income stream. Essentially, cryptocurrency is a digital asset that uses cryptography as a security measure. Bitcoin is one form of cryptocurrency that has been in the spotlight quite a bit. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/is-bitcoin-still-a-thing?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Is Bitcoin Still a Thing?</a>)</p>\n<p>Simon Yu, CEO of blockchain startup StormX told Forbes, \"Millennials are particularly open to embracing new technology in order to create opportunities for themselves — and blockchain, the tech behind crypto, is no different. As masters of the side hustle and challengers of the traditional 9–5 working lives of previous generations, millennials are welcoming blockchain with open arms.\"</p>\n<p>Trading is probably the most well-known method of making money from cryptocurrency, but by no means the only one. Those with an in-depth knowledge of computers can actually mine cryptocurrency, although profits from this are far lower than they were previously. Buying and holding your chosen cryptocurrency is also a popular way to make profits. Rising values have sparked hundreds of stories about how early investors got rich by cashing out their holdings once their value had soared.</p>\n<h2>2. Online trading</h2>\n<p>Where trading stocks used to be relatively complicated to get into, the internet has opened it up to virtually anyone. Trading in the stock market can be a great way to make money online, and you need little more than a laptop or smartphone and an internet connection to get going. By being supremely tech-savvy and learning to trade via apps, millennials are getting more and more involved in the stock trading scene. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-5-millennial-money-apps-everyone-should-use?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">The 5 Millennial Money Apps Everyone Should Use</a>)</p>\n<p>You don't need any specific skills to get started, but it's vital to research properly before sinking your life savings into any particular stock. To get going, open a brokerage account with a reputable stock broker, and then it's a case of finding the right stock that will bring you profits. It's important to know that stock trading always carries a risk, but there are lots of people doing it remotely, millennials in particular, and making it work.

Drop shipping</h2>\n<p>Drop shipping allows people to create online stores and fulfill their orders without ever having to actually handle the inventory themselves. The orders are fulfilled either directly by the manufacturer, or another third party, freeing up the seller to concentrate solely on attracting new customers and selling products. There's no need for warehouses full of stock and you don't have to deal with postage and packaging, so you can set up and operate with extremely low operating costs.</p>\n<p>Once a store is set up and running, it can take minimal effort to keep it going. Sites like <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AliExpress</a> have been specifically created for the purposes of connecting dropshippers with manufacturers, and they make the process even simpler because you don't need to source manufacturers yourself. This type of retail suits marketing- and sales-driven individuals who don't want to be bogged down by the manufacturing and delivery fulfillment aspect of running online stores.</p>\n<p>This trend has become particularly popular among millennials and Gen Z'ers because of internet marketing skills that have grown naturally over a lifetime of use, and it requires little in startup funds to get going.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Blogging</h2>\n<p>With a few minutes and a minimal amount of cash upfront, it's easy to set up your very own blog. Taking it to the next level and monetizing it will take longer, but it's possible to see a decent return on your investment within a matter of months. One of the most important steps is choosing a profitable niche, preferably one that you're already knowledgeable and passionate about so you can write about your subject with authority and enthusiasm right off the bat.</p>\n<p>Once you've built up an audience, there are lots of income streams open to bloggers. Savvy bloggers also create numerous blogs simultaneously to maximize income. Popular moneymaking methods include: recommending products or services to your audience and receiving payments for affiliate sales, advertising on your blog, and creating and selling your own products, like e-books and podcasts.</p>\n<p>Because of they’ve grown up creating content on social media and microblogging platforms like Tumblr, millennials are generally savvy when it comes to creating blogs, building their networks, and nurturing those digital relationships to ensure their content is shared by as many people as possible.

Online stores</h2>\n<p>Forget about renting space, filling it with products, and waiting around for customers to wander in. Online retail shops allow you to set up digitally with minimal upfront costs, and countless ways to actively drive paying customers to your store. Online stores have become big business, particularly with millennials and the rise of smartphones putting products in customers' hands 24/7.</p>\n<p>Setting up is simple thanks to sites like Shopify or Woocommerce, which have easy-to-use templates and models that can get your online store ready to go in minutes. You can sell products you already have, or look for products to sell on both sites. If selling crafty items is more your style, you can create storefronts on Amazon Handmade or Etsy. It's then a case of promoting these stores and their products online using social media platforms.

Ads management</h2>\n<p>Helping companies unlock the potential of online advertising to increase their reach, and ultimately their profits, has gotten more popular in recent years. Since search engines and social media platforms turn to advertising as their main source of revenue, it has opened up endless possibilities. Facebook advertising, in particular, has become a popular way for people to make money through selling ad management services. It's possible to produce extremely targeted advertisements to a specific audience using the data they collect.</p>\n<p>Many businesses are completely unaware of how to use online advertising, and local companies potentially may not even have an online presence, making it relatively easy to sell to them. For a monthly retainer they receive guaranteed, quality customer referrals looking to purchase their services or products.</p>\n<p>Millennials are perfect for gigs like this, as they spend so much time on social media anyway, and have an intimate knowledge of what they and their peers connect to in terms of content.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Though phone plans have improved considerably over the past few years — with carriers making international access a key part of their services — using your phone abroad can still be costly. There are also massive differences between what each company offers, and it can be difficult to determine which one to select if you spend a lot of time on the road. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/8-ways-to-save-on-smartphone-costs-while-traveling?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Ways to Save on Smartphone Costs While Traveling</a>)</p>\n<p>To save you from running up unforeseen bills on your travels, check out these five phone plans that offer cheaper roaming charges.</p>\n<h2>1. AT&amp;T International Day Pass</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.att.com/offers/international-plans/day-pass.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Day Pass</a> from AT&amp;T allows you to take your existing plan with you on the road so you're able to use your data, minutes, and text message allowance. It covers you in over 100 countries, is easily activated online or by calling them, and once it's added to your device, it stays there ready to go for each time you head abroad.</p>\n<p>To qualify for the International Day Pass, you need to have a Mobile Share Plan or the AT&amp;T Unlimited Plan. Conveniently, you only pay the $10 daily fee on the days that you actually use your package, rather than for each day you're abroad.</p>\n<h2>2. T-Mobile One Plan</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/optional-services/roaming.html\" target=\"_blank\">T-Mobile's One Plan</a> aims to be the simplest, most transparent plan on the market and this objective remains the same when it comes to taking it abroad. There's no need to change any settings on your account before your trip because international roaming comes as standard.</p>\n<p>You're able to use your unlimited data in over 140 countries, but only with speeds of up to 128 kbps. This is fine for browsing the web or checking emails but no good for streaming or downloads. If you need higher speeds, you can upgrade to the One Plus plan for $10 per month to get 256 kbps. Texting is also free with the plan. Depending on how many lines you have, prices T-Mobile plans can be as low as $40 per month.</p>\n<h2>3. Sprint Global Roaming</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.sprint.com/en/shop/services/global-roaming.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sprint Global Roaming</a>, international roaming coverage is enabled at no extra cost in more than 200 countries. In 165 destinations that are deemed \"low service areas,\" the package also includes free texts, free data and low-speed data, and calls at just 20 cents per minute. It should be automatically configured on your smartphone without you having to do anything, so you can simply up and go whenever you want without having to worry about changing your package.</p>\n<p>The service supports data speeds of up to 2G, which is good enough for basic web usage and things like map navigation, but won't cope with streaming or downloading. If you're a heavy user or need quicker speeds, Sprint has high speed data add-ons that will give you speeds up to LTE. In most destinations the cost will be $5 per day or $25 per week, and you can add this service even if you're already abroad. Sprint's basic plans start at $40–$60 per month.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>4. Verizon Travel Pass</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.verizonwireless.com/solutions-and-services/international-travel/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon's Travel Pass plan</a> is virtually identical to the AT&amp;T International Day Pass, allowing you to take your existing plan with you to over 130 countries for a daily fee. In Mexico and Canada, you'll pay an additional $5 per day, and $10 per day in other countries. You'll be able to use your talk, text, and data.</p>\n<p>You only pay for the days that you actually use the service, and not for each day that you're abroad. Verizon's regular unlimited plans come in at $75 per month for a single line and go as low as $40 per line ($160 per month) if you have four lines.</p>\n<h2>5. Google Project Fi</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fi.google.com/about/plan/\" target=\"_blank\">Google's Project Fi</a> virtual network came up with a unique way of pricing its plan to give people the ability to only pay for what they use. You pay a flat rate of $20 per month for text and calls, then you pay $10 per GB of data that you use. The plan's simplicity means that it remains exactly the same providing you're in one of the 170+ destinations where they provide coverage.</p>\n<p>One thing to note with Project Fi is that you have an extremely limited number of phones to choose from that are compatible with the network.</p>\n<h2>Alternatives to using mobile roaming data</h2>\n<p>Regardless of which provider you choose, there are pros and cons to using your data package abroad. However, to keep the costs down, there are ways to reduce your time spent using roaming data. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/technology-hacks-for-the-international-traveler?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Technology Hacks for the International Traveler</a>)</p>\n<h3>Buy a local sim card</h3>\n<p>Depending on where you go, local sims are often the cheapest way to get data at a far lower price. Having used these all over the world, in my experience, they usually range in price from absolutely free to around $10. You can then access local prepaid rates that tend to be cheaper than international roaming rates.</p>\n<h3>Stick to Wi-Fi</h3>\n<p>Wi-Fi hot spots are available virtually everywhere, many are free of charge, and they can also provide quicker speeds than cellular data services. If you're able to save your online activity for when you're in range of one, or at your hotel or in a coffee shop with Wi-Fi, you'll save even more.</p>\n<h3>Extend your data</h3>\n<p>There are lots of apps available that help to extend your data by compressing it, so you use less than you ordinarily would. Many apps also have options in their settings to compress their data usage, including the Chrome browser, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>\n<h3>Turn off background data usage</h3>\n<p>Lots of apps use your data even when they're not actually being used, which can lead to those unexpected, and unbelievably high bills upon returning home. Your process to restrict or turn off background data usage depends on what model of phone you have. You can ordinarily do this in settings or on specific apps.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Not only can they save you time, and help you avoid the hungry crowd with mobile ordering, but they can also save you money. Sure, fast food is known for being affordable, but fast food apps can actually help you score free food. And who doesn't love free food?</p>\n<p>Of course, the best way to save money on fast food is to avoid it altogether and cook all your meals at home, but we live in the real world of unexpected traffic and busy schedules, and sometimes you need to grab something quickly. All of these apps allow you to order ahead of time to skip the line when you pick up your food and offer rewards for discounts and freebies. Bonus!</p>\n<p>Here are our favorite 20 fast food apps and the delicious perks that come with them.</p>\n<h2>1. BJ's Brewhouse</h2>\n<p>My local BJ's always has a wait of about 30-40 minutes on weekend nights. Luckily, with the app you can put your name on the waitlist before heading to the restaurant and cut down on wait times. The app also rewards members with a free mini pizookie (a pie and cookie hybrid, usually served with ice cream) when they sign up, and orders earn members one point for every dollar spent. Once you have earned 100 points, you will receive a $10 off coupon good for 90 days.</p>\n<h2>2. Burger King</h2>\n<p>The Burger King app promises $30 worth of food coupons once you sign up, but in reality, it's BOGO free coupons and other discounted meals. You can also connect your PayPal account to the app for faster payment.</p>\n<h2>3. CafÃ© Rio</h2>\n<p>The CafÃ© Rio app rewards users $10 credit for every 100 points they earn. Usually, you will earn one point for every dollar spent, but many times the app will also reward double points. And your rewards don't expire.</p>\n<h2>4. Chick-fil-A</h2>\n<p>I love the Chick-fil-A One app because it's always rewarding me with a free food item. Sometimes it's an ice cream cone, other times it's a salad. The app will also give you rewards for using the app to pay for food directly.</p>\n<p>And if you haven't used the cow calendar yet, you are missing out. Each year in November, Chick-fil-A restaurants sell $8 calendars that come with cards that have a free food item each month. This card connects to your app, making it simple to redeem your free food item of the month. Didn't grab a calendar in time? Check out eBay. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-to-score-free-food-at-chick-fil-a?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Ways to Score Free Food at Chick-fil-A</a>)</p>\n<h2>5. Chronic Taco</h2>\n<p>Chronic Taco adds 50 points to your account right when you sign up. You will also earn one point for every dollar spent at the restaurant. Just 25 points can be redeemed for an order of churro bites, 50 points for a taco, or 100 points for any menu item.</p>\n<h2>6. Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf</h2>\n<p>The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf app offers a free coffee or tea at sign-up. The app also gives app users a free birthday treat and reward points for every purchase you make (a point for every dollar spent). Redeem points toward free drinks and food items. You'll even unlock certain freebie levels (Purple, Platinum, and VIP) with regular use.</p>\n<h2>7. El Pollo Loco</h2>\n<p>Earn $10 of free food through the LOCO Rewards every time you earn 100 points by scanning the app, either at the drive-thru window or ordering through the app. You also score a free entree worth up to $7 at sign-up. Each dollar you spend at El Pollo Loco is worth one point, and soon, you will be able to load gift cards straight to the app.</p>\n<h2>8. Firehouse Subs</h2>\n<p>As soon as you sign up for the Firehouse Subs app and reward program, you will earn a free large drink, and then a free sub on your birthday. You will also earn one point for every $0.01 you spend, which can be redeemed for free subs and salads.</p>\n<h2>9. Jack in the Box</h2>\n<p>The Jack in the Box app offers special in-app offers like two free tacos with any purchase or 10 percent off your order. You can also save your favorite order for quick and easy one-tap ordering.</p>\n<h2>10. Jamba Juice</h2>\n<p>Jamba Juice gives new users $3 off your order once you activate your account. You'll also earn a free treat for your birthday, and a $3 reward for every 35 points you earn.</p>\n<h2>11. Krispy Kreme</h2>\n<p>Did someone say free doughnuts? Sign up for the Krispy Kreme app to receive a free Original Glazed doughnut upon registration and on your birthday. You can also earn free boxes of doughnuts and beverages after so many purchases, which is a nice bonus if you're in charge of snacks for your office or child's school.</p>\n<h2>12. McDonald's</h2>\n<p>Compared to other fast food chains, McDonald's offers coupons and rewards on their app that are quite decent for lovers of fast food or those who find themselves in a dinnertime pinch. The app gives you instant access to food coupons, like $2 off a Signature Crafted sandwich through mobile order and pay, or free fries with any purchase on Fridays.</p>\n<p>Additionally, McDonald's also offers McCafe rewards, which allows you to earn a free McCafe drink after purchasing five — no size limits.</p>\n<h2>13. Panera Bread</h2>\n<p>MyPanera Rewards gives members rewards for three things: for their birthdays, for spending, and just because. There have been months when the app rewarded me a free coffee or a free bagel for every day of the month — no additional purchase necessary. I also like that the app rewards a free food reward after so many visits, not based on how much money I spent.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>14. Pick Up Stix</h2>\n<p>Every dollar you spend at Pick Up Stix will earn you one \"Fortune.\" After you earn 100 Fortunes, you can redeem them for a free entree. Sign up for the app through Facebook to receive free Fortunes.</p>\n<h2>15. PizzaRev</h2>\n<p>PizzaRev fans can earn one point for every dollar spent through the app. Once you earn 100 points, you can redeem them for a free pizza or entree salad. Rev Rewards members also receive free treats on their birthday.</p>\n<h2>16. Starbucks</h2>\n<p>With the Starbucks app, you earn two stars for every $1 spent, and a free drink or food item for your birthday. You also get a free drink or food item for every 125 stars you earn. They will often offer reward promotions for buying certain beverages, as well. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/7-starbucks-savings-hacks-that-actually-work?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">7 Starbucks Savings Hacks That Actually Work</a>)</p>\n<h2>17. Sonic</h2>\n<p>With the Sonic app, you instantly get a free slush reward at sign-up. And new offers are applied to your Sonic app account each month. Also, every month features a deal for a $1.99 Wacky Pack, which is a Sonic's kid's meal. Other deals are usually for half-off blasts, shakes, or floats. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/best-kids-eat-free-restaurants?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Best Kids Eat Free Restaurants</a>)</p>\n<h2>18. Subway</h2>\n<p>Eat fresh and earn tokens for every purchase you make at Subway. Earn 100 tokens, and you will be rewarded with a $2 off coupon. You will also earn bonus surprises, such as a free cookie on your birthday. This app also has surprise deals that can be redeemed through your phone.</p>\n<h2>19. Whataburger</h2>\n<p>The Whataburger app rewards you based off visits rather than the amount of money you spend. If you use the app on five separate visits, you will have your choice of a free honey butter chicken biscuit, medium French fry, taquito, cinnamon roll, or a small shake on your next visit.</p>\n<h2>20. Yogurtland</h2>\n<p>Sign up for Yogurtland’s Real Rewards program to earn an initial free three-ounces for registering and another free three-ounces on your birthday. You earn a point for every ounce purchased. Yogurtland’s reward program is tiered (Green, Raspberry, and Platinum), so once you earn 60 points, you can move from Green to Raspberry and earn three-ounces free for every 36 points earned.</p>\n<h2>How to save even more with fast food apps</h2>\n<p>Obviously these apps were created to get you to spend money on fast food in order to score free food, but here are three ways you can spend less and still get rewards.</p>\n<h3>Buy discounted gift cards</h3>\n<p>Look for discounted gift cards on eBay and other reputable gift card sites to save a small percentage on your fast food budget. Load that card to your account and earn points through the app. Warehouse clubs, like Costco, also offer discounted cards to Jamba Juice regularly.</p>\n<h3>Take advantage of gift card promos</h3>\n<p>Sometimes these restaurants will offer a deal like, \"Buy $X worth of gift cards get a meal or drink for free.\" You can buy the gift cards to get the free item in one transaction and then load the gift cards on the app in order to keep earning rewards without spending more money to do so.</p>\n<h3>Do separate transactions to use more coupons</h3>\n<p>You usually can't combine coupons in a single transaction, but luckily, several fast food places are fine with you having separate transactions in order to take advantage of more than one coupon.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Violence, wars, terrorism, and drugs can all destroy a country's image and leave lasting negative consequences for its tourism industry.</p>\n<p>But if you're looking for a budget vacation that's a little out of the ordinary, then consider exploring countries that for one reason or another haven't always enjoyed the best of reputations. Here are four affordable destinations that are actually less dangerous than you might think. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-of-the-safest-countries-to-visit-in-2018?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">5 of the Safest Countries to Visit in 2018</a>)</p>\n<p>*All cost estimates are taken from Numbeo.com, a trusted source of user contributed data for the cost of living in countries, and leading hotel site Booking.com.</p>\n<h2>Rwanda</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rwanda's recent history has been deeply shaped by the brutal civil war that was waged here in the early 1990s, and in so many ways it's still struggling to overcome the devastating aftermath. Up to a million people are estimated to have been killed during the unrest and the genocide that followed. Though this war ended over 20 years ago, for many it's still the first thing that springs to mind when Rwanda is mentioned, deterring some potential visitors.</p>\n<p>Today, the landscape in Rwanda is very different, and though the scars remain, it's beginning to build a reputation as one of the continent's finest tourist destinations. It's now widely regarded as one of the safest and most politically stable countries in Africa. At the time of publishing, the U.S. State Department rates it as having the lowest possible travel advisory level, with no current security alerts.</p>\n<p>Despite its diminutive size, it packs a punch far above its weight in terms of attractions. Known as \"The Land of a Thousand Hills,\" its undulating terrain is home to some incredible scenery and rare animals. This includes the famous National Volcanoes Park where you'll find some of the world's last remaining mountain gorillas.</p>\n<p>Rwanda is also rated as one of the most affordable countries to visit in the region. A meal at an inexpensive restaurant will set you back just $2.88, and a room in a budget hotel will start at around $30 depending on which area you're in.</p>\n<h2>Morocco</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>North Africa has developed a less than stellar reputation in recent years having been blighted by numerous acts of horrific terrorism. Morocco has also experienced terrorist-related incidents in the past, and it should be pointed out that the U.S. State Department says that \"the potential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens exists.\"</p>\n<p>However, the State Department’s travel advisory level for Morocco is currently at level 1, the lowest possible level, and there have not been any terrorist attacks in Morocco since 2011. It's widely considered one of the safest countries in the region and its continued high levels of tourism bear testament to this.</p>\n<p>Exquisite architecture intricately decorated with tiled mosaics, bustling marketplaces full of vibrantly colored spices and fabrics, and swathes of sand dunes stretching out for miles on end are just some of the reasons to visit Morocco. The cuisine is also a huge draw, with richly spiced dishes mixing sweet and savory to mouth watering effect.</p>\n<p>Thanks in part to the large numbers of tourists it receives, Morocco is one of the most reasonably priced countries in the region. Budget rooms are available starting at around $30 and a meal at an inexpensive restaurant will cost a little more than $3.</p>\n<h2>Colombia</h2>\n<p></p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>The shadow cast by drug kingpins like the notorious Pablo Escobar still lingers over Colombia, and these associations have proved difficult for the South American country to eliminate. Potential visitors still sometimes fear accidentally getting caught up in the drug trade, being kidnapped by guerrilla fighters, and becoming the victim of organized gang violence. This hasn't been helped by the recent release of popular movies and TV series on the subject.</p>\n<p>While these fears would have been well founded in the '80s and '90s, Colombia has worked hard to free itself from the clutches of organized crime. In the process, it's begun reinventing itself as a favored tourist destination for travelers wanting a taste of this previously unexplored South American country.</p>\n<p>Colombia has an attractive mixture of cutting edge modernity and a diverse range of breathtaking, untouched landscapes. This is showcased in cities like Medellin, whose stunning scenery includes swathes of lush jungle and a Caribbean coastline filled with pristine beaches.</p>\n<p>Colombia is also one of the most affordable countries in South America. That’s one reason it's currently enjoying a wave of popularity among young backpackers. Even in the bigger cities, budget rooms are available for less than $25 per night and a meal at an inexpensive restaurant will cost less than $4.</p>\n<h2>Jordan</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Middle East is widely regarded as a no-go zone by many people who view the entire region as dangerous. This opinion is fueled by the political instability and well-publicized conflicts that are still ongoing in countries like Syria, Iraq, and Palestine. Because of this, the Middle East in general is not considered your typical vacation destination, and there's a lot of fear around visiting.</p>\n<p>The tiny country of Jordan, however, is trying its hardest to buck the trend and has become something of an \"it\" destination in recent years. Though there are safety warnings for the areas close to the borders it shares with some of its neighboring countries, it's stable politically and generally safe to visit.</p>\n<p>The main reason that people come to Jordan is to visit the famous archaeological wonder and UNESCO World Heritage site, Petra. This ancient city is made up of buildings that were meticulously carved into the red sandstone rock face over 2,000 years ago, when it was the epicenter of a vast empire.</p>\n<p>But that's not all there is to Jordan. Modern cities like Amman and exciting adventure activities available make it a diverse location.

An inexpensive meal will cost around $7.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

After all, older adults are more likely to be sitting on a large nest egg and are often resistant to getting financial help from others for fear of losing independence. Both of those traits make them tempting targets for scammers and con artists.</p>\n<p>However, just because scammers traditionally like to hit up Nana and Poppy does not mean that young adults are shielded from the problem. In fact, according to a recently released Federal Trade Commission study, more adults aged 20–29 reported losing money to financial scams in 2017 than did any other age group. The study found that 40 percent of adults in their 20s lost money to fraud, as compared to only 18 percent of people over the age of 70 — although the median amount lost was lower among 20-somethings than among the elderly.</p>\n<p>We've done a great job of helping to alert older adults to the dangers of financial fraud. Now we need to make sure everyone else also knows what they need to do to steer clear of scams. Here is what you need to know about protecting yourself from financial fraud.</p>\n<h2>The most common types of fraud</h2>\n<p>Of the types of fraud reported to the FTC, the three most common scams were debt collection (23 percent), identity theft (14 percent), and impostor scams wherein the scammer pretends to be either a government official, a loved one in trouble, or someone else the victim knows (13 percent).</p>\n<p>Although debt collection was the issue most commonly reported to the FTC, impostor scams were the type of fraud that cost victims the most money. Consumers reportedly lost $328 million total in 2017 to this type of scam.</p>\n<p>Each of these types of fraud requires a different protection strategy, and savvy consumers should use all of these approaches to make sure they are covered in case of any type of fraud.</p>\n<h2>1. Know your debt collection rights</h2>\n<p>Getting a phone call from a debt collector can be nerve-wracking for anyone, and debt collection scams rely on your natural fear of financial consequences. The best way to avoid becoming a victim of such a scam is to know your rights as a borrower. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, any debt collector who contacts with a claim that you owe payment is required by law to tell you the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The name of the creditor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The amount you owe.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fact that you can dispute the debt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The fact that you can request the name and address of the original creditor if it is different from the current creditor.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a debt collector doesn't provide this information when first contacting you, he or she is required to send you written notice that includes this information within five days of that initial contact.</p>\n<p>It is a red flag if you receive a call from a debt collector who balks at providing you with this information. In addition, while debt collectors have the right to be persistent and can tell you the potential consequences of failing to pay your debt, intimidation tactics to get you to pay what they claim you owe are also a common scheme from con artists.</p>\n<p>You also have the right to refuse to discuss any debt until you receive a written validation notice from the creditor, which must include the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor, and a description of your rights under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</p>\n<p>Asking for this notice will protect your rights with legitimate debt collectors and scare off any scam artists who are trying to make a buck off your fear.

Freeze your credit to protect yourself from identity theft</h2>\n<p>Identity theft is the 21st Century boogeyman, and for good reason. Our information is only as secure as the company that has collected it. No product or service can wholly protect you from the possibility of someone using your identity.</p>\n<p>However, you can make it more difficult for hackers and scammers to get hold of your identity by <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-freeze-your-credit?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">freezing your credit</a>. With this process, you pay a small fee to each credit reporting bureau (which has been waived by Equifax in the wake of their recent data breach), and no one, including you, can open new credit in your name until the freeze is lifted.</p>\n<p>This is one of the most effective tools in fighting identity theft, since you take out the possibility of human error. The most common method identity thieves use to steal your information is by calling and asking you. Such a thief will pretend to be from your bank or another institution you trust and will request things like your Social Security number and birth date. Even if you fall victim to this kind of fishing scam, a credit freeze can ensure that the thief is unable to live large on your credit.

Ask for specifics to prevent impostors from getting your money</h2>\n<p>Impostor scams come in two common varieties: impostors pretending to call from the IRS or another government or official agency, and impostors pretending to be a loved one who is in trouble. In both cases, the impostor will play on your emotions — fear of an audit, fear for a loved one — to get you to wire money to their account.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the more specific information you can ask for, the better your chance of scaring off the impostor. For instance, if you are contacted by someone claiming to be an IRS agent, you can request the caller's name, badge number, and callback number and say you will get back to him or her. Then, you can contact the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at 1-800-366-4484 to find out if your caller is an actual IRS employee who has a legitimate reason for contacting you.

If someone calls claiming to be from your bank, ask him or her for a name and callback number, and get in touch with your bank via their main phone number to determine if the issue is legitimate.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the loved one impostor scam can be stopped in its tracks by asking the caller (or emailer) to verify certain information that only your relative would know. If you are still feeling unsure, ask for a callback number in this case, too, and contact another family member to find out if there is any possibility your cousin Emma is stuck in a hospital in London before you start wiring money.

If you are named executor of the estate, the heirs have the right to expect you to turn over their inheritance in a timely manner. Part of settling an estate is dealing with the personal possessions of the deceased. Often this must be done before the house or condo can be sold, or the lease terminated, and the estate closed out. The more possessions the departed owned, the more difficult this task can be. Some triaging is in order.</p>\n<h2>Before death</h2>\n<p>If your loved one is elderly, it's a good idea to encourage and help them to dispose of clutter and organize their possessions as an ongoing project. Focus on how discarding piles of old newspapers could make their home safer, or on how those clothes from the 1940s might be appreciated by the high school theater department. A wonderful project to do with an elderly loved one is to organize old photos, because there may be people in them that you can't identify without their help. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/why-holding-onto-too-much-stuff-is-a-burden-for-your-loved-ones?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Why Holding Onto Too Much Stuff Is a Burden for Your Loved Ones</a>)</p>\n<p>While doing these projects, if it feels right, you can gently inquire about any items they might be saving for particular family members, which is especially helpful to know if the person <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/heres-what-happens-if-you-dont-leave-a-will?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">hasn't created a detailed will</a>. The process may be frustrating and time consuming — after all, they may have had this stuff since before you were born, and it can be understandably hard to part with such things. But the more you can do with the cooperation of the property's owner, the easier things will be after they're gone. You run less risk of accidentally disposing of important papers or family treasures.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the decluttering process is prompted by a move. When my elderly cousin had to move into assisted living, my family and I gradually cleared out the house she had been living in for decades. While she wasn't able to help us on site, we were able to set aside possessions we thought she might want to keep, bring them to her new home, and have her make decisions. Many of the old photos and letters we found were great conversation starters during our visits, especially when her memory began to fail.</p>\n<h2>Immediately after death</h2>\n<p>If your loved one was living in their home up until the day they died, you may need to check on the home immediately after leaving the hospital, to make sure it's secure and safe. Of course, if your loved one had pets, they must be attended to and rehomed without delay.</p>\n<p>Within the first week, you'll want to clear out the kitchen to prevent problems with pests, mold, and odor. Clean out the refrigerator and get the trash out of the house. Discard or give away any nonperishable pantry items.</p>\n<p>If you have not already done so, you may also need to immediately look for items to be used in the funeral. If your loved one is not being cremated, you may need to retrieve a nice outfit for the body to be dressed in. It's common to display photos, awards, and other mementos at funeral services, as well. If you're writing the obituary, you may find useful information in the home, such as school yearbooks or scrapbooks. Any record of military service is important to gather, so that your loved one can receive the posthumous honors they are due.</p>\n<h2>After the funeral</h2>\n<p>A few years ago, my family lost an uncle who was the last of his generation. After the funeral lunch, we gathered in his home and experienced the strange feeling of being allowed to roam through his rooms uninvited. I suspect even my eldest aunts felt a bit like naughty children. We were all sad, but it was also a little bit … fun.</p>\n<p>On your first visit to start sorting through the home of the deceased, take a deep breath and look around so you can remember how the home looked when they lived there. Remember that while the task you are undertaking will be difficult and sad, it may also be exciting, because you could uncover letters and other relics from the past that may help you come to know your loved one better than you ever did when they were alive.</p>\n<p>Here are a few steps to make the task of clearing out their belongings less stressful.</p>\n<h3>1. Sort through it all</h3>\n<p>There are two ways to sort through the personal possessions in the home of the deceased. One way is to comb through everything yourself, which can be exhausting. The second way is to hire an estate sale company to sort through everything for you. Many reputable estate sale companies offer sorting and trash removal as part of their service. In fact, they advise that you throw nothing away, because you might inadvertently chuck something of value. I actually tossed an old automobile company shareholder brochure into the trash while sorting through my relative's home, only to have second thoughts and retrieve it. It ended up selling for $20. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/12-financial-moves-to-make-when-a-loved-one-dies?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">12 Financial Moves to Make When a Loved One Dies</a>)</p>\n<p>In exchange for preparing and conducting the sale, the estate sale operator keeps a percentage of the proceeds, and may also charge fees. Such an arrangement could save you a lot of work. However, keep in mind that if you don't sort through the home yourself, you may miss items of sentimental value that you didn't know were there. The sale operator may promise to set aside any family photos and documents, but they won't know as well as you know what you would want to keep.</p>\n<p>This happened to me. A few months after my cousin's estate sale was over, I was online researching her obituary. Imagine my shock when I found, online, images of her original baptismal certificate and her parents' wedding certificate, written in Slovak calligraphy. These documents had apparently been sold on eBay, but I couldn't find the original listing so I had no chance to contact the buyer or seller. The most charitable assumption I could make was that the estate sale company had inadvertently sold these items that obviously fell into the \"sentimental value\" category.</p>\n<p>If you decide to do the sorting yourself, I have a few recommendations based on experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bring a friend or family member along for help.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Drag trash and recycle bins through the home as you work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pack up boxes of papers to sort through in the comfort of your own home.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't throw away anything old before checking its value. You'd be surprised what people buy on eBay!</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Make sure that heirs get a chance at keepsakes</h3>\n<p>Beyond any specific property named in the will, you probably want to make sure that everyone who was close to the deceased gets a memento to remember them by. This is tricky territory, because many decadeslong family fueds have started over granny's handmade quilts or even Uncle Joe's second-best TV trays. Some families may leave this task to the closest surviving relative.</p>\n<p>But if there are a number of survivors of equal status, you might need a more formally mediated approach. After my great uncle passed, my family used an interesting method of distributing property of both sentimental and practical value: a family auction. All the heirs walked through the house and bid on the items there, with the moderation of an auctioneer. Every dollar they paid went into a pot, later divided equally among them. You can do such a private auction before an estate sale, or in place of one. Another system is to run an auction with points instead of cash, with each relative starting with the same number of points.</p>\n<h3>3. Sell what can be sold</h3>\n<p>If you decide to hire an estate sale company, interview and research the candidates carefully. The online review website Angie's List reports that Auction Services listings, which include listings for estate sales companies, make up one of its most complained-about categories. Thirty percent of those reviews score a D or F from customers.</p>\n<p>Before a sale, you should remove anything from the house that the family intends to keep. Make it clear to the auction company what you're keeping, because they will base their prices on the amount they estimate they can make from the sale. If a sentimental item is too large for you to remove before the sale, make sure the sale company clearly marks it as not for sale.</p>\n<p>Assuming you do want an estate sale, it's not a given you'll find an estate sale company that will agree to work with you. If the house has a lot of stuff but no high-value items, many estate sale companies will refuse to take on the job because they typically earn their money by keeping a percentage of the sale's proceeds.</p>\n<p>In that case, you may be forced to run the estate sale yourself, list items in the local paper, or find a low-end operator to take the job on the cheap. Make sure to check the local regulations before advertising a garage sale.</p>\n<h3>4. Dispose of what can't be sold</h3>\n<p>Once you're down to items that no one in the family wants that also aren't worth enough to sell, your next step is to donate what you can to charity. Typical items in this category are: used clothing that doesn't qualify as vintage, worn furniture, and everyday dishes. The most expeditious way to get this stuff out of the house is to request and schedule a pickup with a local charity. Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Habitat for Humanity are three that commonly make pickups; your area may have these or others. If you don't find a charity that will pick up your items, you could pay movers to deliver the stuff to the nearest resale shop, or deliver it yourself.</p>\n<p>Try to avoid dumping stuff on the curb — some cities will fine you for this. If you can't get a charity to take the items, you could list them on Freecycle or advertise them on Craigslist as available for free. Also, some newspapers don't charge to print ads for free items.</p>\n<h3>5. Pay for junk removal if you must</h3>\n<p>If you're able to do the work of getting the junk out of the house, check with your local government offices to see if you can get a large trash receptacle parked at the curb or schedule a large item pickup for free or at a low cost. You can also check with your local home improvement store; some now sell large heavy duty bags or bins that you can fill with thousands of pounds of junk and call them to pick up. The bag option usually costs only about $150-$200, compared to about $300-$850 to rent a trailer-sized trash receptacle for a week and have it hauled away full. Cost really depends on your area and the amount of stuff you're tossing.</p>\n<p>The more expensive option is to pay a full-service junk removal company that will come into the home and remove everything you ask them to. These companies may charge $500 per truckload. On the upside, the work for you is minimal.</p>\n<p>Once you have removed, given away, sold, donated, or thrown away every last item in your loved one's home, you're ready to bring in a housecleaner for a thorough cleaning, and list the home for sale.</p>\n<p>This is a good time to devote some attention to the mementos that you decided to keep in your own home. Display knickknacks in a case, hang a framed photo on the wall, or get that ring resized so that you can see these precious things and be reminded of your departed loved one often.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Research shows that a whopping <a href=\"https://www.allianzlife.com/-/media/files/allianz/pdfs/newsroom/2018-allianz-generations-ahead-fact-sheet-3.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=1EEE6760599516273AC49A4712924887E665A52A\" target=\"_blank\">57 percent of millennials</a> spent money they hadn't planned to spend because of what they saw on social media. Here are some of the sneaky ways social media gets you to spend more, and what you can do to avoid it.</p>\n<h2>1. Impulse buys</h2>\n<p>Social media makes it easy for you to hand over your hard-earned (digital) cash with frictionless in-app purchases, like unlocking game levels, adding monthly subscriptions, and shopping for items recommended by people you follow. Within seconds, you can tap or swipe your way into an expensive, unplanned purchase.</p>\n<p>Avoid this impulse by making it your policy to save the photo of the item or subscription and revisit it at a later date. Chances are, by the time you look at the saved photo later, you won't want the item as badly, or at all. Another strategy that works for me is looking up the reviews of the item before buying. A lot of the time, items that are super trendy on social media get terrible reviews in real life. Find a mental trick that works for you, like telling yourself you'll wait until the item is on sale, to delay purchasing until you've thought it through.

Suggested posts</h2>\n<p>Social media algorithms may not be helping you in your quest to save money. If you've shown interest in anything from fashion, to coffee, to beauty products, the algorithm on platforms like Instagram remembers what it thinks you like and shows you similar content and products. When you open up the app, the algorithm may then show you a barrage of things you should buy — and they're usually tailored to your preferences, making it doubly hard to resist.</p>\n<p>To avoid this influx of temptation, be sure to avoid the Explore page on Instagram or skip over suggested posts if you can. You might not be able to avoid all temptation, but you'll definitely cut down on the sheer number of tempting photos you see. Also, avoid \"liking\" photos full of products, so the algorithm doesn't push similar content into your feed.

Those sneaky influencers</h2>\n<p>If you follow any influencers, your best bet is to unfollow them if you want to keep your hard-earned cash. Seeing someone else's perfectly-curated and styled life is a surefire way to feel unsatisfied with what you currently have, especially if the influencer has (as most do) cultivated an approachable persona.</p>\n<p>Remember, influencers are <em>not</em> just like us. That entire line of Tom Ford lipsticks, the stylish new watches, and the new clothing line at Nordstrom were probably all provided for free, as was the trip on a private yacht to a beautiful island getaway to show off all their new wares in front of epic scenery. If you start trying to keep up with your favorite influencer's lifestyle, you'll quickly end up in the poorhouse.</p>\n<h2>4. FOMO</h2>\n<p>It's telling that fear of missing out, aka FOMO, has become common parlance on social media. Most of us, to some extent, want to keep up with everyone else. And we fear being left behind, or being seen as not up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Remember that trends come and go fast, especially on social media. Once you buy that latest gear, watch, or stylish outfit, in a few months, the next trend cycle will be pushing another product. Instead of buying something to fit in with the crowd, think about whether it truly fits in with your needs and lifestyle.

An expanded social circle</h2>\n<p>Before the advent of social media, it was hard enough to resist comparing ourselves to our friends, but it's even more difficult now with our drastically expanded circles on social media. The increased frequency of social contact online has also made it harder to resist spending. Whereas before social media, you might've seen that uber-rich high school classmate once a year, now you see what she's doing everyday on Instagram. In fact, 88 percent of millennials believe that social media makes them compare themselves more with others.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>Consider unfollowing people you barely know on social media, especially if they're a bad influence on your shopping habits. Instead, interact with closer friends more frequently — social media algorithms usually show you posts from accounts you interact with more frequently — rather than acquaintances you barely know, and will probably never see again in real life.

Endless MLMs from old friends</h2>\n<p>Not long ago, it seemed like every time I opened Facebook, another friend was hawking leggings, skin care, or essential oils from a multilevel marketing (MLM) company. Wanting to support friends who are trying to make ends meet is an admirable goal, but doing so can quickly add up, especially with the high prices of most of these MLM products. Before long, buying a few products I didn't need had completely wiped out my \"fun\" money for the month.</p>\n<p>Facebook allows you to stay friends with a person, but to stop allowing their posts to show up on your feed. All you need to do is unfollow. Eventually, I had to block the feeds of more than one person to prevent my feed from turning into one huge ad. Those friends can still send messages to me, but I don't see what they post unless I consciously go and check out their page. And now, when people approach me about MLM products, I tell them that I already have a supplier.

Hyper-targeted ads</h2>\n<p>Sometimes it seems as if the internet is reading your mind. Advertisers on social media are able to target you based on the data you generate by using the platform. Everything including the movie you streamed recently, the ramen shop you checked in at, and your political leanings are accessible in this new marketplace, making it harder to ignore ads that seem custom-made for you.</p>\n<p>In the interest of preserving your hard-earned cash, take steps to prevent ads from being quite as eerily targeted toward your likes. Clicking on the small triangular \"AdChoices\" logo on any online ads served to you will take you to a page run by an organization called the Digital Advertising Alliance. Once you get to the AdChoices page, you can opt out of having ad networks target you with personalized information. It won't block ads entirely, but it will help you avoid the onslaught of personalized ads.</p>\n<h2>8. Go off the grid</h2>\n<p>It may seem old-fashioned, but it's nice to take a break from social media sometimes if you feel you're too caught up in the constant marketing ploys. Research shows that spending a lot of time on social media can have negative effects on your mental health. Try consciously unplugging over the weekend and spending that time with friends in-person, or limiting yourself to an hour a day of social media time throughout the week.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Card skimmers can be installed at ATMs, restaurants, gas payment terminals, and even store check-out lines. The phony equipment is small and can be hard to spot. Some card skimmers even include a phony keypad that fits over the real one to steal your PIN.</p>\n<p>Your debit card account number can be stolen if you swipe your card in a skimmer. Unlike credit card transactions, debit cards may not offer much protection against fraudulent purchases. Your checking account could be emptied, and you might not be able to reverse the charges.</p>\n<p>Your best defense against debit card skimmers is vigilance and awareness. Here are a few ways to protect yourself.</p>\n<h2>1. Spot a skimmer before you swipe</h2>\n<p>When using a card terminal, look it over before you swipe. It can be difficult to spot a well-hidden skimmer, but some clues can help.</p>\n<p>If the terminal you are about to use does not match the other ones at the location, you might be looking at a skimmer. Number pads that look mismatched or are an odd size are a red flag. Press on the card receiver and wiggle the keypad; skimmers are designed to be retrieved quickly by thieves and may have loose parts. A keypad that is sitting on top of the machine rather than flush with the surface of it can also be a sign of a skimmer. If you're at a gas station, look at the card scanner at the pump you're about to use; ensure that the security tape is still intact over the panel before you insert your card.</p>\n<p>When you're choosing a payment terminal or ATM, go for one that is close to store employees, a security camera, or is in an open and well-lit area. These are less likely to have been tampered with by thieves that do not want to be noticed. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-tips-to-save-you-from-an-atm-skimmer?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Tips to Save You from an ATM Skimmer</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Dip, don’t swipe</h2>\n<p>If you have the option to insert your card into the payment terminal rather than swipe, do that. Chip cards, otherwise known as EMV cards, are much more secure since they do not pass your actual account numbers to the retailer. Even if someone steals the numbers from an EMV transaction, it is not useful to thieves since a unique number is generated for each transaction.</p>\n<p>Some stores have not yet adopted chip readers and will still ask you to swipe your card through a magnetic card reader. If you swipe your debit card instead of dipping it, you risk your account information to skimmers. Some thieves have taken to \"shimming\" rather than skimming; tampering with chip reader machines by installing a paper shim to block the chip reader, forcing people to swipe their cards instead. If in doubt, pay with cash. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-ways-chip-credit-cards-make-life-easier?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Ways Chip Credit Cards Make Life Easier</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. Don’t let your debit card out of your sight</h2>\n<p>At restaurants, the normal payment procedure is to give your debit or credit card to the waitstaff who takes it away to swipe it. If you hand your debit card to someone else to process, they can run your card through a second card reader and steal your information. Or, someone could simply write down your account number and the security code from your card and use it for fraudulent transactions. The best security practice is to never let your debit card out of your sight and pay for your restaurant meals with cash.</p>\n<h2>4. Monitor bank statements</h2>\n<p>You can monitor your bank statements regularly to spot suspicious activity early in case a criminal does get your account information by skimming your debit card. If you do find fraudulent transactions, work with your bank to close your account right away and minimize your losses. Your bank may offer automatic account alerts to make monitoring your account easier.</p>\n<h2>5. Withdraw cash at the bank, not the ATM</h2>\n<p>I prefer to withdraw cash at the bank a couple of times a month instead of stopping by an ATM every time I need cash. I show my driver’s license at the bank to make a withdrawal — no debit card is required. Not only does getting cash at the bank eliminate the risk of debit card skimming, but you avoid any ATM fees as well.</p>\n<h2>6. Pay with a credit card instead of debit card</h2>\n<p>Of course, the best way to protect your debit card from skimmers is not to use your debit card. It is safer to use a credit card for transactions since credit cards offer protection from fraudulent purchases. If you don’t want to pay interest to use a credit card, simply pay off the credit card balance every month. Using a credit card provides a barrier between your checking account and thieves who could skim your account information from your debit card. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-reasons-credit-is-safer-than-debit?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Reasons Credit Is Safer Than Debit</a>)</p>\n<p>Another option is to pay with cash to avoid the risk of skimming altogether. I use an <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-envelope-system?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">envelope budgeting system</a> and pay for all food expenses with cash. This greatly reduces the number of card transactions I make each month, and therefore reduces my risk of having account information stolen by a skimmer.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

These essentials will make traveling without your precious babe a whole lot easier. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-life-skills-for-working-moms?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Life Skills for Working Moms</a>)</p>\n<h2>1. Milk delivery and/or storage system</h2>\n<p>If you don't want to worry about keeping your pumped milk fresh, try a milk delivery service like Milk Stork. Starting at $139, Milk Stork ships a 34 oz. cooler to your hotel and comes with a pre-labeled and postpaid package to allow your fresh milk to get back home quickly without spoiling.</p>\n<p>If you're traveling for work, your employer might be willing to pay for this service. If not, you might be able to write it off on your taxes, since it is considered a work-travel expense.</p>\n<p>If you don't use a milk shipping service, you will need to stay in a hotel room that has a fridge or freezer. The hotel might allow you to store your cooler of milk in their main freezer, but it's best to call ahead of time to see what they have available to accommodate new moms.</p>\n<h2>2. Cooler and ice packs</h2>\n<p>If you decide to store and transport your milk yourself, take an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2He5Clw\" target=\"_blank\">airtight cooler</a> and plenty of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2HbYrdz\" target=\"_blank\">gel ice packs</a>. If you're flying, this will count as a carry on, so plan accordingly. This is not an ideal method of transporting milk home if you will be traveling for more than five days. Breast milk is good for one day transported in a cooler with ice packs, in the fridge for up to five days, and in the freezer for several months.</p>\n<p>It's a good idea to smell your milk before use. If it smells sour, you need to dump it.</p>\n<h2>3. Automatic and manual breast pumps</h2>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GXKsdH\" target=\"_blank\">automatic breast pump</a> will allow you to pump quicker and more efficiently than the manual handheld versions. I also recommend bringing along a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2qapuxX\" target=\"_blank\">manual pump</a> for when you need relief but can't use your automatic pump.</p>\n<h2>4. Milk storage bags</h2>\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JpyIz8\" target=\"_blank\">milk storage bags</a> instead of bottles to save room in your hotel fridge and cooler, and to make life a little simpler. These can be stored in the freezer, and are much easier to transport than clunky bottles.</p>\n<h2>5. Sterilization bags and wipes</h2>\n<p>Medela makes <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GAok5O\" target=\"_blank\">quick clean wipes</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2q7cHvS\" target=\"_blank\">sterilization bags</a> to make cleaning your pump parts and bottles easy on the go. The wipes are great for cleaning your pump in the airport or at the office, while the sterilization bags can be used in the microwave and eliminates 99.9 percent of germs and bacteria on pump parts.</p>\n<h2>6. Extra batteries and adapters</h2>\n<p>It's a good idea to bring extra batteries for your automatic pump just in case it loses power in a moment when you really need it to work. Having a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2H1nPoU\" target=\"_blank\">breast pump adapter</a> is also very helpful to have on hand.</p>\n<h2>7. A wet bag</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Hc2bMe\" target=\"_blank\">wet/dry bag</a> is a great way to store pump parts after you are done using them. Wet bags are also extremely versatile, and new parents can use them as waterproof storage for dry cloth diapers or anything else that needs to be put away immediately before being cleaned.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>8. Nursing Attire</h2>\n<p>Button down blouses are the perfect career-friendly nursing attire, since they look professional and are easy to discreetly pump in. Wear a hands-free pumping bra underneath so that you can pump and multi-task at the same time. Bring a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JoZ9EO\" target=\"_blank\">nursing cover</a> or fashionable wrap with you if you want more privacy when pumping on the plane or in the airport.</p>\n<h2>Employee rights and breast-feeding</h2>\n<p>If you are traveling for work, know your <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">rights as a new mom</a> at work. Make sure to discuss travel accommodations and your work needs when you're on the road. For example, will your employer provide you with a hotel room that has a fridge or freezer or pay for the delivery of your milk back home? Will your working location have a private room you can pump in and store milk when you are away from your hotel room? How many breaks will you receive to pump? Inquire about all of these things beforehand.</p>\n<h2>Your travel rights</h2>\n<p>Whether you travel for work or for other reasons, it is also important to know your rights when it comes to TSA and flying. First of all, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/BreastPumps/\" target=\"_blank\">FDA</a> considers the breast pump a medical device. Some airlines allow passengers to bring the pump on the plane and not count it toward the carry-on limit. However, other airlines might not be so generous. Know your airlines' guidelines and plan ahead so that you aren't stuck at the gate with more carry-ons then you are allowed.</p>\n<p>In regards to bringing breastmilk on board, <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/special-procedures/traveling-children\" target=\"_blank\">TSA laws</a> are in your favor. Per the TSA, you aren't limited to the three-ounce liquid rule when it comes to breast milk, but you need to declare your milk and supplies. You are allowed to bring a cooler, breast milk, bottles, and ice packs on the plane. Ask the TSA agent to change their gloves before opening up your cooler to inspect the milk. They might swab the outside of the milk bags, but they will not open up the bags. Ask to talk with a supervisor if you have issues.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Fortunately, I realized something wasn't quite right and backed out at the last minute, but there are many people who haven't been as lucky. After a bit of research, I came across dozens of travelers who have fallen for it — one who even lost $30,000 attempting to book a luxury villa for six months. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/what-to-do-about-a-terrible-airbnb-stay?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">What to Do About a Terrible Airbnb Stay</a>)</p>\n<p>Here's how this particular scam works, and what you should always look for when booking through Airbnb.</p>\n<h2>The scam</h2>\n<p>There are numerous ways this scam can occur, but they all start when you begin communicating with the host about a property that seems like a great deal. Perhaps you send them a question via Airbnb, and they ask you to email them instead, as it will be easier or more convenient. Or maybe you've found a property on a different site like Craigslist and you begin with an email conversation. Either way, once you take the communication off the Airbnb messenger, they will begin to hook you in by being helpful and friendly.</p>\n<p>They will answer any queries you may have and tell you a convincing story as to why their property is slightly below market value. Once you reach the stage of being ready to book, they will send you a link to the Airbnb listing asking you to complete the booking through the site as it offers protections for both of you. So far so good, right?</p>\n<p>When you click the link, you'll be taken to a site that looks and feels like Airbnb, and for all intents and purposes seems totally legit. You'll be able to read reviews of the property and enter the dates that you want to book it for, and even the URL will look genuine. You'll then complete the next stage of entering your dates and making a payment to secure the booking. But if you do, you will immediately lose all of the money.</p>\n<p>As a seasoned world traveler, there are subtle differences that I picked up on before paying the $3,000 dollars to secure the property I was interested in, but that many other people might miss. The first red flag was that the property's full address was listed on the property page, but Airbnb only shows the exact address once you've booked and paid. Then I noticed a live chat function at the bottom of the page that I used, but I’m familiar enough with Airbnb that I know it doesn't offer a live chat function. This was clearly not the real Airbnb site.</p>\n<p>The best way to avoid falling for this ruthless scam is to always make sure you book directly through Airbnb, either through their secure app, or by manually entering the URL directly into your browser.</p>\n<h2>Other common Airbnb scams</h2>\n<p>Here are some other common Airbnb scams to watch out for.</p>\n<h3>Advance fee scam</h3>\n<p>This is where someone will offer to give you a discount or something else in return for paying in advance and not using the Airbnb payment method. They'll probably justify it by claiming you'll both save on fees and they'll pass part of that savings on to you. While it may sound great, you'll more than likely lose that money and the payment will be untraceable.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Phishing scam</h3>\n<p>You'll be sent an email that looks as though it's from Airbnb, asking you to click on a link and enter some personal details such as passwords or payment methods. Scammers will then potentially use this information to gain access to your other accounts. Phishing emails can also contain malware that can harm your computer and also be used to record things like passwords to sites you frequent. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-protect-elderly-loved-ones-from-financial-scams?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Protect Elderly Loved Ones From Financial Scams</a>)</p>\n<h3>Wire transfer deposit</h3>\n<p>You'll be offered a fantastic savings on your booking for paying the deposit using a wire transfer service rather than the Airbnb payment process. Once that payment is received, the property will be taken down and you won't receive your money back.</p>\n<h2>Golden rules for booking Airbnb properties</h2>\n<p>In order to remove any potential for being scammed on Airbnb, follow these safety rules every time you book.</p>\n<h3>Keep all communication on the site</h3>\n<p>Never communicate with hosts outside of the Airbnb messaging portal. If they email you or send you a private number to contact them, this should set alarm bells ringing immediately. If they insist on not messaging through Airbnb, cease contact and report them to Airbnb.</p>\n<h3>Read all the reviews</h3>\n<p>Check the reviews carefully and look out for patterns of cancellations or lots of undetailed, poorly worded reviews.</p>\n<h3>Pay on Airbnb only</h3>\n<p>Always make payments through Airbnb and never respond to any requests to transfer money via bank transfer, credit card, or anything else. Paying outside of Airbnb will make it more difficult to trace the payment or prove that it was acquired fraudulently.</p>\n<h3>Look closely at the URL</h3>\n<p>Double check that you are definitely on the official Airbnb site when you're completing your booking. The best way to do this is to type the site name directly into your browser.</p>\n<h3>Don't trust cheap listings</h3>\n<p>Don't trust properties that are advertised at way below market value. While you can find great deals on Airbnb, unfortunately, if it seems too good to be true, it more than likely is. Hosts want their listings to be competitive and priced similarly to other properties in the area. If a property is listed cheaper than it should be and there's not a clear reason why, it's best to avoid the risk and move on.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

I ran to my parents bedroom excitedly exclaiming, \"I got a quarter!\"</p>\n<p>\"Actually,\" my sleepy dad told me, \"You got a 50-cent piece. That's worth two quarters.\"</p>\n<p>I know firsthand that kids can learn a lot about money from the Tooth Fairy, since I did. I also know that my own kids have been able to learn some valuable money lessons based on the under-the-pillow payouts that they've received.</p>\n<h2>1. The values of different coins and bills</h2>\n<p>Like my father before me, I like to provide my kids with unusual coinage when they lose a tooth. My thought was that it makes it seem more magical if they receive a denomination that they never see otherwise. So my husband and I have always slipped Sacagawea golden dollars under their pillows.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is, for years my oldest child hoarded these coins in her room and never spent one. One day she was gathering up all her money and was frustrated that she didn't have enough to buy something. I suggested she raid her trove of tooth money, and she told me that those weren't \"real money.\" We had neglected to tell her that golden dollars were legally accepted currency, and she had gone years thinking that she was exchanging her teeth for mere trinkets.</p>\n<p>Besides using it as an opportunity to introduce unusual coins, you could use the Tooth Fairy's visit as a lesson by alternating between different combinations of coins, so they learn that four quarters equal ten dimes which equal 20 nickels. But good luck slipping 20 nickels under the pillow without waking them up!

How to handle a windfall</h2>\n<p>As an adult, handling a surprise influx of cash can be one of our tougher decisions. It's always tempting to see a windfall as license to spend freely, but then again, a wisely invested windfall could have a vastly different effect on your life than one you decided to blow.</p>\n<p>If allowance is a kids' \"salary,\" Tooth Fairy money is analogous to a tax refund or a Christmas bonus. Let them decide how and whether to spend it, and watch them learn.</p>\n<h2>3. How to make sure you're getting paid fairly</h2>\n<p>Just like sharp-eyed employees at a company, my kids pay attention to what the Fairy pays their siblings. If someone gets more, they do not fail to speak up about it, and the Tooth Fairy seems to get the message, because future payments tend to be more equal. My kids have also had some success in investigating market rates by asking friends how much they get. Once they reported to me that other friends got more money for top teeth, for example, the Fairy started paying a premium for those as well. Lesson learned: It pays to do your research and demand equal pay.

Sometimes money doesn't show up when you expect</h2>\n<p>As a freelance writer, I know the excitement of hearing the mail carrier approach my door, followed by the disappointment of seeing a pile of bills and no checks coming through the slot. Many children will at some point wake up to find that the Tooth Fairy forgot to come. According to a report by Delta Dental, more than half the parents surveyed at some point forgot to leave money under the pillow — which gives children an opportunity to practice their patience and learn that sometimes you have to wait longer than you expected to get paid.</p>\n<h2>5. The spending power of money</h2>\n<p>Just like me with my 50-cent piece, most little children have no idea what their first Tooth Fairy payout can buy. Take them to the store and let them shop. Next time, they'll have a more concrete understanding of what 50 cents or a few dollars is worth. This will help them better budget their allowance once they start earning one.

How to forecast future earnings</h2>\n<p>Most kids lose their first few teeth in kindergarten, at an age when thinking about the future at all is a challenge. As they get older, kids may realize that they can count on a payout every time they lose a tooth. Really canny ones may even consult a medical text or ask their dentist how many more baby teeth they have to lose so they can figure out how much they've got coming to them.</p>\n<h2>7. No pain, no gain</h2>\n<p>Sometimes one of my kids will let a loose tooth dangle by a thread for days because they're afraid of the small amount of pain that might happen if they pull at it. When this happens, sometimes one of the other kids will comfort them by reminding them that they'll get money once the tooth finally comes out. Sometimes it's just the push they need to face the pain.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

If you're in debt, one of the best ways to motivate yourself to get <em>out</em> of debt is by tracking it. Debt tracking websites and apps allow you to create debt payoff plans, calculate how much interest you'll pay in the process of becoming debt-free, and predict the all-holy debt-free date. Many even let you play around to see what the effect of extra monthly payments are.</p>\n<p>There are a ton of free debt tracking tools, but which one is right for you? As a debt blogger, I've spent three years trying and reading extensively about various tools, and have come up with a list of five that I think are best.</p>\n<h2>1. Undebt.it</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.undebt.it\" target=\"_blank\">Undebt.it</a> undoubtedly has the most features of any debt tracker out there. It's the Cadillac of debt-payoff trackers. This comes in especially handy for student loans and credit cards, many of which have helpful (but complicated) repayment schemes and promotional offers.</p>\n<p>Undebt.it also has a number of options for calculating a debt-payoff plan. You can choose from the debt snowball method (lowest balance first), debt avalanche method (highest interest rate first), or even create a custom payoff plan. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/snowballs-or-avalanches-which-debt-reduction-strategy-is-best-for-you?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Snowballs or Avalanches: Which Debt Reduction Strategy Is Best for You?</a>)</p>\n<p>It even supports the <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/get-out-of-debt-faster-with-the-debt-snowflake?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">debt snowflake</a> method of making small, extra payments as you're able. And you can switch among all these plans whenever you want.</p>\n<p>The only downside of Undebt.it is that it's a bit clunky until you get used to it. The full suite of free features is nice, but it does take a bit of time navigating the website to understand all the ins and outs.</p>\n<h2>2. Unbury.me</h2>\n<p>If Undebt.it seems too confusing, try <a href=\"http://unbury.me\" target=\"_blank\">Unbury.me</a>. Its simple block-style layout is pleasing to the eye, and entering debts is a snap. It's almost <em>too</em> simple, which is why this debt tracker works best if your debts are relatively straightforward with no confusing, shifting APRs or payment schemes. Just remember to sign up for a free account after you enter your debt information to save your work, or it'll all be lost as soon as you leave the page!</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. Mint</h2>\n<p>You might be familiar with the popular budgeting software <a href=\"http://www.mint.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mint</a>, but did you know you can use it to track your debt as well? Using its Goals function, click on \"Pay Off Loans\" or \"Pay Off Credit Card Debt.\" It'll automatically populate the screen with your loans or your credit cards, and ask you to input any missing information about your interest rates and minimum monthly payments.</p>\n<p>By sliding the payment toggle, you can instantly see how much interest you'll save by raising or lowering your monthly payment amount, along with how long it'll take you to get out of debt. Select your payment amount, and follow Mint's instructions on where to send the extra payments.</p>\n<p>The beauty of the Mint system is that it updates automatically, meaning you don't have to login and update your account every time you make a payment. Plus, you get all of Mint's extra budgeting tools.</p>\n<h2>4. Debt Payoff Assistant</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/debt-payoff-assistant/id475099959?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Debt Payoff Assistant</a> app is the most basic, no-frills debt payoff tracker. It comes with three payoff plans to choose from: lowest balance first, highest balance first, and highest interest first. You can also come up with a custom plan if none of these work for you.</p>\n<p>Debt Payoff Assistant doesn't really offer much in the way of visualization except for a pie chart that shows you what kinds of loans make up your total debt. If you really want a graph of your debt over time, try Undebt.it or Unbury.me.</p>\n<h2>5. Debt Payoff Planner Calculator</h2>\n<p>If your debt payoff scheme confuses you, consider going with the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/debt-payoff-planner-and-calculator/id1009323715?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Debt Payoff Planner Calculator</a> app. The strength of this app is that it shows you exactly how much money to send to each debt every month, with the amounts changing as you pay off certain debts. You can choose from three payoff plans: the debt snowball plan, the debt avalanche plan, or a custom plan.</p>\n<p>Again, this app doesn't really show you a great visualization of your debt payoff progress. Choose another debt payoff tracker if that's important to you.</p>\n<p>If you're not sure which tracker is right for you, choose a couple to try out for a month or two.

Marriage typically involves the joint payment of debts just as it involves collecting joint assets, and everything — both assets and debts — must be distributed in some way when a couple calls it quits. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-protect-yourself-financially-during-a-divorce-or-separation?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Protect Yourself Financially During Divorce or Separation</a>)</p>\n<h2>Community property vs. common law states</h2>\n<p>In a lot of ways, what happens to your debts and assets depends on where you live. If you reside in one of the nine community property states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin) or \"opt in\" for community property in the state of Alaska, then all debts accumulated during a marriage are the responsibility of both parties no matter how they were held. This means that if your spouse ran up a secret credit card balance during your marriage, that debt is your responsibility as well as theirs in a community property state.</p>\n<p>If you live in one of the remaining states, then you live in an equitable distribution state (also known as a common law state). Typically, this means that debt incurred during a marriage is the responsibility of both parties, if both parties were joint owners of an account. If one spouse opens an account in their name only, on the other hand, that debt is their sole responsibility.</p>\n<h2>What happens to debt incurred during separation?</h2>\n<p>Note that debt incurred after a couple separates may be treated differently than debt incurred during a marriage. Your liability for such debt usually depends on your state, whether you took out the debt jointly or separately, and whether the debt was used for, say, a spending spree in Las Vegas or necessities for your children such as food and rent.</p>\n<p>Since the moment of separation is figured differently in different states, the cutoff for new debt can also vary. In some states you need to legally separate while others consider the moment of separation as starting when you begin living apart.

This means the court system that handles your divorce will help you figure out ways to split your debts equally and fairly.

It's possible your credit card issuer may not want to help you move part of the debt into a new account in one spouse's name, although they will usually cooperate if both spouses have good enough credit to qualify for an account on their own.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, Boyle says a <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">balance transfer card</a> can be a good way to split up credit card debt if at least one spouse can get approved. \"It all comes down to whether the card issuer approves or not,\" says Boyle. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-divide-rewards-and-keep-your-sanity-in-divorce?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Divide Rewards and Keep Your Sanity in Divorce</a>)</p>\n<h3>Mortgage debt</h3>\n<p>Mortgage debt is handled similarly to credit card debt, except that there is an asset involved, since mortgage debt is secured by your home. If you own a home together and the debt is in both of your names but you get divorced, then it's possible that one spouse can keep the home. In that case, Boyle says most couples go to their mortgage company and ask it to approve the remaining spouse to refinance the home in their name only.</p>\n<p>If there is equity in the home, there are several ways to split it. If one party keeps the house, they could \"buy out\" the other person with cash. \"You could also refinance the home for what it's worth and get cash out,\" says Boyle.</p>\n<p>Another option is for the remaining spouse to get a home-equity loan and use some of the cash to give the other spouse their share of the equity. A final option is to just sell the house and split the proceeds, notes Boyle.</p>\n<h3>Auto loans</h3>\n<p>What about cars? Auto loans can work a number of different ways. Many times, each spouse will keep the car they drive and take over the payments even if both spouses are on the loan. However, it often makes sense for each spouse to refinance the car loan into their own names when they don't want to continue sharing a joint debt after divorce.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h3>Student loans</h3>\n<p>Then there are <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/does-divorce-affect-your-student-loans?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">student loans</a> to contend with. Boyle says that since student loans are taken out by only one spouse most of the time, the debt is often retained by the borrower. However, there are some exceptions.</p>\n<p>\"I've had situations where a spouse might pay off the other spouse's student loans as part of a broader divorce settlement,\" she says. \"Maybe they were the breadwinner or they had more assets.\"</p>\n<h2>Why couples typically split up debts during divorce</h2>\n<p>Attorney Nicholas Dowgul of <a href=\"http://www.feltonbanks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Felton Banks</a> in Raleigh, North Carolina says couples there occasionally continue holding debt together after divorce.</p>\n<p>Basically, if the parties get a divorce and no equitable distribution action is filed, then equitable distribution (property settlement) is waived by both parties and the debt remains in whomever's name it was, says Dowgul. But if it's joint debt, then it remains the obligation of both spouses.</p>\n<p>However, the problem with joint debt after divorce is that one spouse may not stick to the agreement. In that case, the creditor would likely go after both spouses for repayment, regardless of their agreement to remain jointly liable. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-divorce-and-credit?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">What You Need to Know About Divorce and Credit</a>)</p>\n<p>For example, imagine there's a court order from a North Carolina court that says the husband is required to pay the credit card held jointly by the parties, but he stops paying his part of the bill. The card issuer will hold both spouses liable for the debt and repayment, meaning the bank will come after the wife as well, even though, according to the divorce decree, she's not responsible for paying that credit card bill.</p>\n<p>This doesn't mean that the husband would be off the hook, however. If he agreed to hold the debt jointly during the divorce settlement, then he could be held in contempt of court unless he pays what was ordered, notes Dowgul. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/4-myths-about-divorce-and-money-debunked?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">4 Myths About Divorce and Money Debunked</a>)</p>\n<p>To avoid situations like this one where one spouse stops paying their share, many couples opt to pay off joint debts and close all joint accounts, then refinance remaining debts in one or the other's name only. It's just too risky to remain in an account with an ex-spouse, especially if you can avoid the situation altogether by moving debts into separate accounts.</p>\n<h2>What can you do to ensure debt is distributed fairly when you divorce?</h2>\n<p>While Dowgul only practices law in North Carolina and believes people in other states should consult a local divorce lawyer for specific advice, he says he recommends his clients write up a separation agreement once they decide they are going to divorce. A separation agreement should include a basic understanding of who gets what after the divorce, including which person is responsible for each debt accrued up to that point.</p>\n<p>In the state of North Carolina, couples have to be separated a year and a day before a divorce is granted, he says. While there's no requirement in his state that couples get their separation in writing, it makes things easier if the parties can at least agree on matters involving debt and assets upfront.</p>\n<p>Finally, hire a divorce lawyer who can represent you and ensure you're left with a fair number of assets and no more than your share of the debts once your divorce is final. \"The goal of divorce is for each spouse to end with assets of similar value,\" says Boyle. \"It's not always a 50/50 split, but it needs to be a fair split.\"</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Congratulations! While planning a wedding and figuring out how to pay for everything can be stressful, you also get to create a wedding registry and select all the gifts you want people to give you. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-save-big-on-everything-for-your-wedding?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Save Big on Everything for Your Wedding</a>)</p>\n<p>While it's fun to scan house decor and that big screen TV you hope one of your guests will be cool enough to buy, cash would be a lot more helpful to you and your soon-to-be spouse. You don't need fancy place settings or sheets with a high thread count, but how can you ask friends and family members to skip the shopping spree and hand over the dough without sounding tacky?</p>\n<p>Here are three strategies that work.</p>\n<h2>Create a specialized registry</h2>\n<p>You aren't the only one who wants cash gifts for their wedding, which is why many online donation registries are available. Sites like Honeyfund and Traveler's Joy allow you to create a wish list of items like a dolphin excursion for your honeymoon or new cabinets for your kitchen in your condo, and your guests can donate money to help you pay for those things. Your wedding guests will feel like their money is going toward a good cause, and you will be able to cash out after your wedding.</p>\n<p>Note that some of these registries will charge you a small 2 to 3 percent transaction or processing fee (and your guests if they use a credit card). Also, many of these registries will take a few weeks to deposit your funds into your bank account, so plan your honeymoon accordingly. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/10-money-saving-gifts-to-put-on-your-wedding-registry?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">10 Money-Saving Gifts to Put on Your Wedding Registry</a>)</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, don't skip the registry! Some couples think that if they skip the registry altogether that guests will automatically give them cash. Instead, some guests might take this as a sign to give you anything. You might end up with three toasters and floral bedspreads that you would never choose to buy. At least with a registry, you can get items you selected, and you know where to return them if you don't like the gifts. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/alternative-wedding-registry-ideas?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">Alternative Wedding Registry Ideas</a>)</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Do the dollar dance at your wedding</h2>\n<p>During your wedding, the DJ will announce to the guests that the dance floor is now open for anyone who wishes to dance with the bride or groom. The DJ will also mention that for those who want to help the couple have an extra special honeymoon, this dance is the time to hand over the bills. The \"dollar dance,\" also known as the \"money dance\" or the \"apron dance,\" is socially acceptable and expected in many cultures.</p>\n<p>This dance is extremely awkward, but it also gives older relatives a chance to relish in this special moment and say a sweet word to the bride or groom away from the crowd. My family and my husband's family expected the dollar dance, and even though it made both of us cringe, we are glad we did it. We earned about $400 from the 20-minute dance session, and that moment gave my grandma and aunt a chance to dance and welcome my husband to the family without feeling embarrassed. I thought no one would want to dance with us, but it did end up being a sweet way to thank guests for coming and make them feel noticed.</p>\n<p>However, it is important to think about your guests. Will they think the dollar dance is a fun tradition or would they be offended? For my wedding, we were surrounded by people who just wanted to bless us financially, but we were also a young couple just starting out. Older couples that are perceived to have high-paying jobs might not get the same reaction from their guests if they did a dollar dance.</p>\n<h2>Word-of-mouth</h2>\n<p>Let a few close family members and friends know that while you have a registry, you are also saving money toward a down payment on a house or a kitchen renovation. Ask them to mention this to anyone who asks for registry help or gift ideas. For example, when your old school grandmother asks your mom how to work the registry, your mom can say, \"I can take you shopping this week, but I heard that Jane and Mark are trying to save up for a down payment on a house this year if you would rather contribute the money to that.\"</p>\n<p>The idea is that your wedding guests aren't hearing directly from you that you want cash. You don't want your wedding to feel like a call for money handouts. You also have to realize that many guests might prefer to give checks, but they just don't know how much to give. For example, gifting a nice punch bowl seems more gracious to many people than handing over the cost of the bowl. Word-of-mouth can also help in these tricky situations. Close friends can say, \"I'm just going to give them a $40 check for their honeymoon. I know every little bit will be appreciated,\" when other friends ask what they are gifting.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

As a precaution against tourists overstaying their visas, many countries require that you prove your intention to leave. Usually they pass the responsibility of checking this onto the airlines, meaning you'll probably be asked for what's known as \"proof of onward travel\" when you're checking in at your departing airport. If you don't have a ticket to demonstrate how and when you'll be leaving the country, you may be prevented from boarding the aircraft.</p>\n<p>But what if, like many long-term travelers, you don't have an exact itinerary or solid idea of how and when you're going to leave? Here are six ways to provide proof of onward travel without having to compromise on the spontaneity of your trip.</p>\n<h2>1. Buy a refundable ticket to depart</h2>\n<p>By booking yourself a fully refundable ticket to anywhere outside of your destination, you'll have irrefutable proof that you intend to leave the country when you say you will. Even in the unlikely event that the airline checks your reservation, then you have a ticket that is legitimately valid.</p>\n<p>Print the travel details before arriving at the airport so you have them, if requested. Once you're safely in your new destination, cancel the ticket and redeem your refund.</p>\n<p>This is probably the safest way to provide proof of onward travel, but you need to pay close attention when reading the terms and conditions before finalizing your booking. While some airlines claim to offer refundable tickets, what they actually offer is the price of your ticket returned in voucher or credit form. These tend to only be redeemable with the same carrier, and the cash that you've forked over won't be coming back to you. Also, refundable tickets tend to be significantly more expensive than a regular fare, so be prepared to pay extra up front.</p>\n<h2>2. Book a 24-hour refundable ticket</h2>\n<p>Under the 24-Hour Reservation Requirement, mandated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, all U.S. airlines and foreign air carriers marketing to U.S. customers are obligated by law to \"allow a reservation to be canceled within 24 hours without penalty.\" Many other carriers and flight brokers offer the same terms when purchasing flights with them.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to use this 24-hour cancellation period to your advantage. First, you can book a ticket, wait for your reservation details to come through, and print them off before immediately canceling. You run the risk that the airline you’re flying will check your return reservation and see it canceled, of course, though it's rare they do anything more than look at the documents you provide. If you choose this option, book with a different company than the one you're flying with so it's not as easy for them to check the reservation.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can purchase the onward ticket on the day of your flight so it's valid regardless, and as long as you arrive at your destination within that 24-hour period, you can cancel the departing flight when you land. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-save-money-on-flights-using-fare-alerts?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">How to Save Money on Flights Using Fare Alerts</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Expedia.com offers free one-click 24-hour cancellation on most flights. You don't have to call the airline or talk to a representative, as there's an easy cancel button that will allow you to get a full refund with no questions asked. Just make sure that the flight says \"Free 24-Hour Cancellation\" during the booking process at Expedia.com.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. Use fare rental sites</h2>\n<p>An entire industry has arisen because of the need to provide onward travel, with companies like BestOnwardTicket offering a fare rental. For a fee of around $12, companies like this will purchase your chosen tickets based on the details you provide. They will then automatically cancel them within 24 to 48 hours, depending on the option you select.</p>\n<p>It's similar to booking a ticket yourself, but you don't have to worry about canceling it as that responsibility falls to the fare rental company. There are no concerns around having the funds in place for the ticket in the first place, and you don't have to do anything to secure that refund. You also don't have to spend time looking for a carrier that offers a refund or searching for suitable flights yourself.</p>\n<p>Note that some companies offering this service should not be trusted, so make sure to read customer reviews and thoroughly vet their terms and conditions before paying any fees.</p>\n<h2>4. Get a pre-booked itinerary from a travel agent</h2>\n<p>Pre-booked travel agent itineraries are more commonly used for visa applications where it's important to show not only your onward travel details, but also your timetable for your entire journey. As part of this, many travel agents offer a service where they will hold airline tickets for a certain period of time for you, usually between seven and 21 days.</p>\n<p>It's similar to the fare rental services, but they tend to be slightly more expensive at $35 and up. The benefit of these itineraries is that they can be used by people traveling to multiple countries because you're able to put more than one flight on them. Companies such as Flight Reservation for Visa and Visa Reservation offer competitive services.</p>\n<h2>5. Purchase a cheap ticket</h2>\n<p>In some instances, the most hassle-free option may be to purchase a cheap ticket to another country. It will give you peace of mind knowing you have an authentic ticket in your possession, and depending on where you are in the world, tickets can be extremely low-priced. Budget airlines regularly do flash sales, and many have routes that are always affordable.</p>\n<p>Remember, proof of onward travel doesn't have to be a flight, either, so you have many options to find an affordable ticket out of the country. Bus journeys or ferry crossings are commonly cheaper than flights, and you can often book them online in advance. This option also comes without the inconvenience of having to go through a refund claim.

Sign off</h2>\n<p>Some airlines allow you to sign a contract at the departing airport saying that you don't have valid proof of an onward journey, but you do have means to leave the country. If you arrive at your destination and are turned away by the immigration officers, this contract simply relieves the airline of any responsibility or liability for bringing you into the country, and you'll be required to pay for a deportation flight ticket yourself.</p>\n<p>I recently signed a document like this flying with Air China from Tokyo to Manzanillo, Mexico. Upon arriving at the airport, I was not asked about onward travel and was allowed into the country as usual.</p>\n<p>If you arrive at the airport without proof of onward travel, you may want to speak to a manager at the check-in counter and request to sign a contract that will allow you to risk the journey.</p>\n<p>Note: This is still a risky way to go, because if you don't know the regulations in the country you're arriving in and you do get turned away, it could be a costly endeavor.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Emergency vet bills can quickly make a huge dent in your savings, and that could leave you in a tough spot during an already stressful situation. Can your pet receive the care he or she needs, or will you have to euthanize the animal because you can't afford the treatment? If you plan ahead, you can avoid the latter. Here's how.</p>\n<h2>Get pet insurance while your pet is healthy</h2>\n<p>When my dog, Jaxon, was about a year and a half old, he was admitted to the vet with a respiratory infection that filled his lungs with fluid, which required several nights in the hospital. The bill for the treatment was nearly $8,000, a fee that my husband and I couldn't afford as a young couple in New York City. Unfortunately, we also were unaware that we weren't allowed to leave the hospital without paying the bill in full, and emergency pet care facilities sometimes do not accept payment plans.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, we had insurance to cover it. We paid the full amount to the hospital on our credit cards and then had to wait to be reimbursed by the insurance company (a caveat to consider) after we submitted the claim. But it was a small price to pay to save Jaxon's life. If it weren't for the insurance, we would have had no choice but to put him down at that point. In hindsight, it was a valuable lesson to learn about emergency vet bills and pet insurance, and the life-or-death difference it can make.

So it's a good idea to keep a copy of them at your home so you can grab and go when needed.</p>\n<p>\"If your pet has an ongoing medical condition, it would be best to bring any recent medical records, [and] X-rays with you,\" says Dr. Gary Richter, veterinary health expert with Rover.com. \"Similarly, if the reason for the visit is because the pet got into something that could be toxic, bringing the exact product or a picture of a label is very helpful. The more information you can provide to the team at the emergency clinic, the easier things are going to be.\"</p>\n<h2>Bring some form of payment with you</h2>\n<p>Even if you haven't figured out exactly how you're going to pay the bill, you will need to show some form of payment (especially if you don't have insurance) if you'd like your pet to receive care. Don't leave home without it.</p>\n<p>Most facilities have an initial exam fee, after which they'll provide an estimate for recommended testing and treatment. Costs can range from under $100 to thousands if the pet is in critical condition. You'll then have some time, but perhaps not much time if the situation is critical, to make your decision on what you can afford and how to proceed with the care.

At the very least, you should have enough to cover your pet insurance deductible, but more will likely be necessary if you don't have pet insurance.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<p>\"If you forgo insurance, you should have at least $2,500 set aside for your pet,\" advises Jme Thomas, executive director of Motley Zoo Animal Rescue in Redmond, Washington. This is, sadly, really hard for a lot of people to do, but instantly when your dog gets hit by a car, that's pretty much what you're looking at to start — not even for the ongoing care and treatment. We feel that's a slightly conservative estimate [for the actual care], but a relatively typical amount for an emergency fund.\"</p>\n<h2>There are credit options specifically for these emergencies</h2>\n<p>If you're in the hospital with your pet and you're trying to figure out how to pay for the bill, CareCredit could be an option for you. You can apply for this medical assistance credit line in advance, possibly at your veterinarian's office, or online, just so you have it on hand when the emergency arises. You can also do it at the emergency vet's office at the time, if needed.</p>\n<p>Your qualification for this card is based on your credit situation, like any other card would be, so you can't have a terrible score, Thomas says. But it's not as harshly critical of your score as, say, a mortgage lender would be.</p>\n<p>\"This is what saves a lot of people's pets in the end,\" she adds.</p>\n<h2>Don't let emotion control the situation</h2>\n<p>You want to save your pet, there's no doubt about that. But one practical question you need to ask yourself when your pet has an emergency is if going into debt for the treatment is worth it. That may seem harsh, but you need to keep a roof over your own head if you want to be able to afford caring for another living creature.</p>\n<p>Adds Dr. Richter, \"When people are faced with these kinds of choices, they need to weigh the costs with the pet's prognosis and how spending the money will impact their lives. An excellent long-term prognosis — broken leg, for example — may warrant spending the money, whereas end-stage terminal cancer is a more difficult decision.\"</p>\n<p>In the end, it's your decision, but you shouldn't compromise your ability to provide for yourself. It defeats the whole purpose.

Making sure you’ve got a strong internet connection and plenty of power can be challenging on the road. Without those, your productivity will suffer, which could cost you big bucks. Here are four tech add-ons to stock up on before your next trip that can save you both time and money.</p>\n<h2>Wi-Fi range extender</h2>\n<p>If you're working while traveling, you probably spend a significant amount of time holed up in your hotel room, hunched over your laptop. Or if you're taking a well-earned vacation, you might choose to relax by streaming a movie or listening to some music. The problem comes when you find yourself confined to a room that's far from the router with a patchy signal. The speed can slow so much that it feels like you've gone back to the days of dial up.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there are devices that allow you to seamlessly connect as if the router was right next to you. <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oQxR1R\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi range extenders</a> increase the coverage areas and boost the strength of slow connections in areas farther from the router. All you need is the network's password, and to be at least on the edge of the signal to set it up. Most hotels offer free Wi-Fi to their guests (or for a small fee), so you should have no problem getting their network password. Vacation rentals will most likely include this for you to use, as well.</p>\n<p>There are two main kinds of Wi-Fi range extenders available. One plugs into a wall socket and picks up the signal from the router by amplifying it and then transmitting it again. This allows anyone with the password to access the extended network, so it's the preferred kind to use if you have multiple devices, or if there is more than one person who needs to use the Wi-Fi connection. However, it does mean that you need access to a wall socket, which may be difficult depending on where you are.</p>\n<p>The second type is a mini antenna that plugs directly into the USB port of your laptop. It will pick up a weak signal and turn it into a strong, consistent connection. The benefit of this model of Wi-Fi extender is that you don't need a wall socket to use it — making it more convenient when there isn't one available. However, it will only work for the device it's plugged into, and many models only connect to laptops, meaning your phone or tablet will still be out of commission. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-to-slash-the-cost-of-wi-fi-when-you-travel?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">6 Ways to Slash the Cost of Wi-Fi When You Travel</a>)</p>\n<h2>Portable charger</h2>\n<p>When you're in a foreign country, you tend to rely on your gadgets even more heavily than when you're at home. Smartphones have become indispensable traveling tools that enable you to do anything from booking accommodation and searching for directions, to downloading your boarding pass or ordering an Uber.</p>\n<p>But, virtually all of your entertainment devices require a charged battery to function. Whether it's an e-reader, a tablet, a camera, or a Bluetooth speaker, they all need to be juiced up to be of use while you're on the go.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oUWU3w\" target=\"_blank\">portable charger, also known as a power bank</a>, can help you avoid a dead battery while you’re out and about. You can charge your devices on the go, instead of needing to be chained to a wall socket while waiting for your devices to charge.</p>\n<p>Power banks come in all shapes and sizes, and hold varying amounts of power. Tiny, lipstick-sized power banks will fit in your pocket, while the highest capacity models are understandably more bulky, but can power anything up to the size of a laptop. You can even get solar powered power banks, which will convert the sun's rays into battery juice.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>Portable Wi-Fi router</h2>\n<p>If you're a frequent traveler who is constantly connected to the internet, then a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oUKEA5\" target=\"_blank\">portable Wi-Fi router</a> may be a good investment. Essentially, it's a router that works like any other, allowing you to wirelessly connect multiple devices at the same time. The difference is that a travel router accesses the internet through a tethered cellphone, using a sim card and USB cord. You can create your very own private Wi-Fi network anywhere there's cellular coverage, whether you're on the beach or lounging by the pool.</p>\n<p>The best portable Wi-Fi routers are unlocked, so you can pick up a cheap local sim card in whichever country you're in. Or, you can purchase a global sim that gives you coverage across several countries, but these are often more pricey than a local sim. If you're going to a country where you're able to use your regular data package, like Mexico, you can even use your existing sim card.</p>\n<p>Beware, though: Not all portable Wi-Fi devices are created equal. This is particularly true in regards to speed, as some are capable of providing standard 3G, right up to 4G+ connectivity to allow super quick downloads. They also come in different sizes, the most practical of which can easily fit in your pocket.

They're usually over in milliseconds and occur multiple times per day in electrical circuits all over the world.</p>\n<p>There are two main types of power surges that occur, with multiple potential causes. First, there are surges sparked by outside events, like storms, lightning strikes, or compromised power lines. Unfortunately, these are usually very strong and there's not much you can do about them.</p>\n<p>Then there are surges that arise inside, usually caused by faulty electronics or when high-powered electrical devices are in use. The demand that elevators, refrigerators, or even hairdryers momentarily put on an electrical circuit can result in a potentially devastating power fluctuation.</p>\n<p>There are many countries across the globe where the power supply simply isn't as advanced or reliable as it is in the U.S. If you want to prevent having your precious electrical devices fried by an unexpected power surge then you need to add a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2HfMWAH\" target=\"_blank\">travel surge protector</a> to your packing list.</p>\n<p>It plugs into the wall socket like a standard travel adapter, and you plug your devices into it. The surge protector acts as a barrier to stop any electrical spikes from cooking your electrical gadgets, saving you the potential inconvenience and cost of replacing them.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

We all have 24 hours a day, and seven days a week, to achieve our goals. However, it seems like some people have tons of free time, and others never have enough hours in the day. If you are constantly struggling to find the time to get stuff done, you probably need a little more discipline in your life. Here are 10 classic time management fails — that many of us struggle with — and how to fix them.

You are a masterful procrastinator</h2>\n<p>Remember those homework assignments that we put off until the last second? Or deadlines at work that we're desperately trying to meet the night before? We've all done it. You convince yourself that there's just not enough time in the day to do what you need to do, but tomorrow you can get it done. Of course, when tomorrow turns into today, the same thought takes over again, and eventually, it becomes a last-minute rush and you find yourself muttering \"I wish I had more time.\" Thing is, you had it. You just didn't have enough discipline to make use of it.</p>\n<p>Stop waiting for tomorrow. Even if you can't finish it today, you can still get started. Start breaking down your tasks and goals into smaller, more manageable steps you can accomplish each day, eventually leading you to the finish line.

You don't take advantage of modern technology</h2>\n<p>Now more than ever, we have all the tools we need to become masters of time management. You have, at your fingertips, some of the best apps available to help you organize your time down to the second, including calendars, reminders, task managers, list makers, and so much more. If you are constantly wishing you had more time, but are not taking advantage of these great (and usually free) tools, you're missing out. Once you start using them, it will become second nature.

You haven't established a morning routine</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to get better with time management is to start off the day in the right frame of mind. A morning routine can be tough to establish, especially if some mornings are way different from others. Do what you can to carve out 30 minutes that will set you on the right track for the rest of the day. It can be as simple as a quick shower, drinking coffee while catching up on the morning news, a brisk walk around the block, and five minutes of meditation. Do whatever works for you. But do it daily, and it will ground you for a less hectic day.

You make too much time for fun</h2>\n<p>Isn't it funny how there's \"not enough time to do everything,\" but there's always time to see that new movie, head to the ballgame, or go on a shopping trip? That's just human nature. We make time for the fun stuff because it's, well, fun.</p>\n<p>However, you can't really justify saying you don't have enough time to get work or chores done when you easily make time for the fun things. Even laying in bed and giving the snooze button a few whacks is time that could be spent doing other things. Sure, you need to make time to relax and wind down, but balance that with some discipline so you can go to bed feeling good about the way you spent your day.</p>\n<h2>5. You waste time because you're disorganized</h2>\n<p>You can't find your keys. You forgot something you needed at the store, and have to make a second trip. You can't find that super important work email in your messy inbox. Things like this can really eat into the time you have available throughout the day. Ten minutes here, 20 minutes there, and before you know it, you've wasted two precious hours and gotten nothing done.</p>\n<p>This problem can be eliminated by getting more organized. For example, make a place right next to the door to hang your keys, and get into the habit of hanging them there as soon as you come in the door. Make lists on your phone before you go to the grocery store. Add stars and labels and folders to keep your inbox clean. It may take you some time on the front end to make these organizational moves, but you'll save tons of time in the long run.

You're trying to do too much at once</h2>\n<p>A little multitasking here and there is fine. However, when you decide that the best way to get everything done is to attack it all at once, you're going to run into all kinds of problems. First, your focus is divided between several tasks at the same time, and that will mean each job is only getting a fraction of the attention it deserves. You may also need to be in a different mindset to do one job, and it can negatively impact the work you're doing on the others.</p>\n<p>Mix-ups and mistakes often happen when you're juggling a whole bunch of projects, plus you can feel so overwhelmed that in the end, none of the jobs get completed; or if they do, they're half-baked. Only take on what you can manage successfully, and have the discipline to finish those tasks before attempting any more. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/16-time-and-money-saving-apps-for-freelancers?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">16 Time and Money Saving Apps for Freelancers</a>)</p>\n<h2>7. You tend to rush things</h2>\n<p>When people rush, they inevitably make mistakes that have the exact opposite impact, and they spend more time fixing mistakes than if they had just slowed down and done it right the first time. While it may seem like going faster will get it done faster, it will probably just create problems for you. So, take a breath, slow down, and work at a steady and manageable pace.</p>\n<h2>8. Your goals are ill-defined</h2>\n<p>People who are on top of everything know exactly what they want to achieve. Usually, their goals are written down and planned out, weeks or months in advance. Not only that, but every goal is crystal clear.</p>\n<p>For example, let's take something that we all dread — cleaning out the garage or basement. For those of us who never seem to have enough time in the day, it's just a horrible task on the horizon that we keep putting off. For those with clear goals, it will be compartmentalized and come with a list of dates and objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Day one, go through all old paperwork, shred, and file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Day two, find items to donate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Day three, find items for a garage sale.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so on. \"Clean the garage\" is daunting and feels massive. Breaking the goal into clear steps with deadlines makes life way easier.</p>\n<h2>9. You get laser-focused on one task</h2>\n<p>When you do something, you don't just want to do it well, you want it do it flawlessly. So cleaning the kitchen takes all day instead of half an hour, as you sit on the floor with a toothbrush and a bleach solution getting into every crevice and tile. Cleaning the junk drawer becomes a task that sends you to the store for a new set of containers, and bags, and labels, and zip ties. Tasks that should take minutes take hours, and hours turn into days. Simply by easing off and doing a decent job, not a perfect one, you can save so much time.</p>\n<h2>10. You have trouble making decisions</h2>\n<p>How many of us have spent an hour or more in front of the TV trying to find something good to watch? By the time we land on the perfect movie or show, there's no time left to watch it. The same can be said of deciding on meals to prepare, clothes to buy, or places to visit. Too much time is spent on the act of making a decision, and not enough time spent doing what needs to be done.</p>\n<p>There are ways to get around this, such as apps that help you make decisions, or simply jotting down the pros and cons of the outcome. Get in the habit of making decisions more quickly, and you'll have more time on your hands.

Don't get overwhelmed. These tips will help you to pay off debt faster so you can enjoy your baby's first moments without so much stress.

Don't add to your debt burden</h2>\n<p>Babies can be costly, especially when you're buying diapers and formula weekly. Be as cost-effective as possible when shopping for your new bundle of joy. Do your best to pay for diapers, baby food, and formula out of your normal grocery budget. This may mean juggling some of the normal things you buy to fit in an extra $25 to $50 each week.</p>\n<p>That can feel like a stretch, but it doesn't have to be a drastic one. It might just mean you eat a rice and bean meal once per week, or eat only chicken instead of steak and fish. You won't have to make this grocery trade forever, it's just a means to an end.</p>\n<p>As far as baby gear and clothes go, buy used or use hand-me-downs when possible. The first six months of your baby's life go fast, and items like swings, baby wraps, bath tubs, and rockers are not needed after that time frame, so don't waste your money. Any baby items that require strict safety regulations — like car seats — should be bought new. (See also: <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/dont-waste-money-on-this-pricey-baby-gear?ref=seealso\" target=\"_blank\">8 Things You Definitely Don't Need for a Baby</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. Don't be afraid to ask for help</h2>\n<p>There is no shame in admitting to family members and close friends that you are working hard to pay off debt and raise a baby. They might be able to take care of the baby one or two days a week so you can go to work, or they might have a lead for someone who is looking to hire out a side job. Many times, parents or grandparents are happy to have you over once a week for dinner, which can save you a small amount on your grocery bill.</p>\n<p>Outside of your family and friends, check to see if you are qualified for <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-eligibility-requirements\" target=\"_blank\">WIC benefits</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility\" target=\"_blank\">food stamps</a>. Furthermore, if your debt is a federal student loan, you might be able to lower your payments <a href=\"https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/ibrInstructions.action\" target=\"_blank\">based on your income</a>.</p><!-- midarticle: second half -->\n<h2>3. Refinance and rebalance your debts</h2>\n<p>Write down all of your debts and their APRs. Are you getting the best deal for them, or are you throwing your money away on high interest rates?</p>\n<p>If your credit score is healthy, try refinancing your auto loan, student loan, or mortgage to an arrangement with more favorable terms. The difference from a lower monthly payment can go toward expenses you need for your new baby.</p>\n<p>If you're struggling with credit card debt, consider moving that balance to a <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-best-0-balance-transfer-credit-cards?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">balance transfer credit card</a> with a promotional 0 percent APR. During that promotional window — typically between six and 21 months — interest does not accrue. This can be a tremendously effective way to pay down debt while saving on interest, especially considering that typical credit card rates can exceed 16 percent. Just be sure to pay the balance off in full before the promotional APR ends and the normal rate kicks in.</p>\n<h2>4. Try to survive on one income</h2>\n<p>Another strategy to tackle debt before and after the baby comes is to try to live on one income. Devoting one income to living expenses and the other income to debt repayment can quickly reduce the debt you owe. It takes a lot of sacrifice and budget cuts, but you will get out of your debt situation faster.</p>\n<p>After debt is repaid, one parent can choose to stay home with the baby, which might be a better option financially than paying for child care. Or, both parents can keep working and continue to practice living on one income to supercharge their emergency fund and retirement savings.

Make drastic cuts</h2>\n<p>What drastic cuts can you make during this period of your life? Huge budget cuts are not fun, but they don't have to be permanent changes. Can you sell an extra household vehicle and get by with one? Could you sell some of your clothes, gadgets, or furniture? Can you cut your cable subscription for a while? Could you do a spending ban on anything that isn't an absolute necessity?

Remember that it is better to go extremes now and pay off your debt so you can enjoy growing your family with the comfort of being debt-free.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Like this article?

Car</h2>\n<p>Advertisers work hard to convince us that what we drive defines who we are. But that trick costs all of us money (after all, who wants to be a 1974 Pinto?).</p>\n<p>Don't fall for it. Instead, embrace this revolutionary truth: Cars are simply tools to get us from Point A to Point B. Unburden yourself from an auto loan you can't afford and insurance premiums that bust your budget. Downsize to the safest, most fuel-efficient pre-owned model you can afford.

Wardrobe</h2>\n<p>My sister-in-law once had so many clothes that she purchased three commercial clothes racks and expanded her closet into the basement. If your wardrobe is gobbling up more square footage every year, it might be time to downsize.</p>\n<p>Consider donating items you no longer wear to charities like Dress for Success, Career Gear, or a local community outreach center. You could also sell your clothing, shoes, and accessories to an online consignment shop and make a little extra cash.

Cable and cellphone plans</h2>\n<p>Once we've signed up for cellphone plans and cable packages, we seldom give them a critical review. That inattention means we could be missing out on cheaper options that better match our lifestyle, or special offers that provide the same level of service for less money. Take 30 minutes to see if you can downsize your cable and cellphone plans — and the costs that go with them.

Subscription services</h2>\n<p>From gourmet cheeses to beauty supplies, subscription services deliver the world to our doorstep. But all that convenience comes at a price.</p>\n<p>Take a hard look at your bank statement and your spending habits. Are multiple subscription services nickel-and-diming your budget to death? Is most of that gourmet cheese growing fuzz the fridge? If the answer is \"yes,\" switch to a less expensive subscription package or cancel altogether.</p>\n<h2>5. Spending</h2>\n<p>Forget about the idea of cutting corners for a month or two. When you downsize your spending, you're finding permanent ways to minimize your expenditures. It's a mental and behavioral shift that's the first step in living more frugally. Explore ways to reduce your monthly spending by 10 percent, and then use that money to pay down debt or boost your retirement savings.

Debt</h2>\n<p>Once you've downsized your spending, attack the three-headed monster it created — <em>debt</em>. While it makes perfect sense to pay off debt with the highest interest rates first, many people find more success using the <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-secrets-to-mastering-the-debt-snowball?ref=internal\" target=\"_blank\">debt snowball method</a>. In this approach, you pay off your smallest debt first (regardless of the interest rate), which gives you a motivational boost to stick with your downsizing plan until everything is paid off.</p>\n<h2>7. Schedule and commitments</h2>\n<p>A dear friend of mine recently started a new job with a college on the East Coast. In addition to this full-time administrative role, he's teaching two classes and interviewing students for a grant program. I love him to death, but saying \"no\" is not his strong suit.</p>\n<p>Sound like you? Remember, your <em>time </em>is a rare resource. If you're constantly moving and always stressed, downsize your schedule. Life is short; carve out some time to simply <em>be</em>.
